So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Ciudad\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tupelo\",\n          \"Cincinnati\",\n          \"Tulsa\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you.

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you.

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you.

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God.

So we begin, Oklahoma, we begin. Thank you, Oklahoma. And thank you to Vice President Mike Pence. We begin, we begin our campaign. Thank you. We begin our campaign and I just want to thank all of you, you are warriors. I've been watching the fake news for weeks now, and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors, thank you. We had some very bad people outside. We had some very bad people outside, they were doing bad things. But I really do, I appreciate it. We have just a tremendous group of people in Oklahoma. And I hear, I hear from your two great Senators and your governor that we're doing very well in Oklahoma, that's the word. That's the word. I stand before you today to declare the silent majority is stronger than ever before. Five months from now, we're going to defeat sleepy Joe Biden. Boy, does he get a pass from these people, huh? We're going to stop the radical left. We're going to build a future of safety and opportunity for Americans of every race, color, religion, and creed. Republicans are the party of liberty, equality, and justice for all. We are the party of Abraham Lincoln and we are the party of law and order. Think of what we've done. We will have close to 300 federal judges appointed and approved by the end of my first time, that's an all time record. That's an all time record. I've always heard how important judges are. Now we know how important they are. Think of that over 300, around 300, by the end of the term. And when we have another four years, we're going to have a big, big percentage of the total number. Very important, November 3rd. And two great Supreme Court judges. So we have two justices of the Supreme Court, Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, they're great. They are, they're great. We have two. And we could get a few more, yeah, we can get a few more. We've spent over $2 trillion to completely rebuild the unmatched strength and power of the United States Military. And all of that incredible equipment, whether it's submarines or missiles or rockets or jet fighters, bombers, it's all built in the USA. We passed V.A. Choice. Thank you very much, Jim. Where's my Senator? Jim Inhofe, you better vote for him, he's running, he's great. But we'll get to him and James Lankford in a second, two great Senators. You have two great senators. So we passed V.A. Choice. So if you're a veteran, for years and years, they've wanted to do it for almost 50 years, we got it done. We get a lot of things done. And so if you're a veteran and you have to wait on line for one week, two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks, two months. What happens is you go outside, you get a private doctor, you get fixed up and they pay your bill. We take care of the bill. We take care of the bill and you get immediate service. It's never happened before. And our approval rating at the V.A. is now 91%, that's how good it is. Never been anywhere near that number. Never been anywhere near that number. And V.A. accountability, we had a lot of bad people in the V.A. People that didn't love our vets, people that were sadistic, people that stole, a lot of bad people. You couldn't get rid of them because they were, let's say it could be unions, it could be civil service, right, let's say, let's just say. And so you couldn't get it done. That was another one for decades and decades, they wanted to get it changed. And I got it done with those people and your Congressman, your Congressman who I'm going to introduce. V.A. accountability, and now somebody treats our veterans badly and we look at them and what do we say? We say, you're fired, get out, right? Get out. They got rid of a lot of bad people that were there for a long time. Sort of like me in Washington, draining the swamp. I never knew it was so deep. But it's happening. It's happening, I never knew it was so deep. It's deep and thick and a lot of bad characters. Thank you. We're lowering the price of prescription drugs, making our allies pay their fair share. They get a big bargain on drug prices and enacting fair trade deals. That finally, finally, after all these years put America first. I've been saying it for a long time. We passed the largest tax cuts in the history of our country. The Democrats want to raise your taxes. Tell me about that. Tell me about that. I guess I'm old fashioned. All my life, all my life, I heard politicians want to lower taxes, not raise them. If you could lower him, you couldn't lose. The Democrats want to substantially raise your taxes. How do you figure that? How do you figure that? And regulation cuts, we passed more regulation cuts than any administration in the history of our country. And with the help of our great energy workers, many of them come from the great state of Oklahoma. Do you ever notice that Biden, no, do you ever notice that Biden oftentimes gets the state wrong? He's in Iowa and he says it's good to be in Idaho. No, no, you're in Iowa. He's in New Hampshire and he says it's great to be in Ohio. No, no, no, you're in New Hampshire. That happens to him all the time, hasn't happened to me yet. When that happens, there's nothing you can do to make up for it. You might as well just walk off the stage because the speech is a disaster. Right, right. But we just turned the United States into the dominant energy super power of the world, of the world. And because of the Chinese virus, what happened about three months ago, it looked like we were in big trouble and we were, and I got it back together. I called Russia. Right, I called Russia. I called Saudi Arabia and believe it or not, I called Mexico. Mexico was a little bit tough. That's called OPEC Plus, did you ever hear of OPEC Plus. That's OPEC Plus plus. And we got them to do the right thing and we have our energy back to almost $40 a barrel, meaning you have an energy business again. Almost $40 a barrel. Couple of months ago, it was zero and we were going to lose 10 million energy jobs, 10 million jobs. So Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota, and many other states would have been hurt. Now you think you're going to be hurt there. You try putting AOC in judge of your energy. That will make the pandemic look like child's play to the people in energy. She has one problem, it's called petroleum. No president or administration has done more in the first three and a half years than the Trump administration. Not even close. Nobody. How about the CNN anchor, how about the CNN anchor, you know, did a little shave job in the head, which is fine. And he's standing in front of a building saying, \\\"things are very peaceful here.\\\" And the building is, it looks like the biggest fire I've ever seen. The whole town is burning. It's like the biggest fire. And he said, \\\"Things are very good here, Anderson. I think it's great. These are wonderful people, Anderson.\\\" Did you ever see that? It looked like the world was coming to an end. And we did something in Minneapolis after watching for three or four days, I called, I said, \\\"You got to get \\u2026 you can't protect yourselves.\\\" I got them to take 8,000 National Guardsmen. And in one hour it all ended and they rode through the next three weeks with no problem. And we did the same thing in other cities. But how about Seattle? Isn't that great? So they take over a big chunk of a city called Seattle. I mean, we're not talking about some little place, we're talking about Seattle. Have you ever been to Seattle? They took over a big chunk and the governor, who's radical left, all of these places I talk about are Democrat, you know that, every one of them, every one of them. And I'd have an offer out, I said, \\\"Anytime you want we'll come in, we'll straighten it out in one hour or less.\\\" Now I may be wrong, but it's probably better for us to just watch that disaster. I flew in with some of our great congressmen, who we're going to introduce it a second. And I said to them, \\\"Congressmen, what do you think? I can straighten it out fast, should we just go in? No, sir. Let it simmer for a little while. Let people see what radical left Democrats will do to our country.\\\" But Americans have watched left wing radicals, burn down buildings, loot businesses, destroy private property, injure hundreds of dedicated police offices. These police officers, they get injured, they don't complain. They're incredible. And injure thousands upon thousands of people only to hear the radical fake news say what a beautiful rally it was. And they never talk about COVID. They don't talk about, when you see 25,000 people walking down Fifth Avenue or walking down a street of a Democrat run city, you never hear them saying, they're not wearing their mask. You don't hear their say, as they're breaking windows and running in. And then when I say the looters, the anarchists, the agitators, they say, \\\"What a terrible thing for our president to say, what a terrible thing.\\\" But you don't hear them talking about COVID, COVID, to be specific, COVID-19. That name gets further and further away from China, as opposed to calling it the Chinese virus. And despite the fact that we \\u2026 I have done a phenomenal job with it, I shut down the United States to very heavily infected but all people from China in late January, which is months earlier than other people would have done it, if they would have done it at all. I saved hundreds of thousands of lives. We don't ever get even a mention. Then I closed it down to Europe early, closed it down because I saw what was happening. And by the way, most people said, don't do it, don't do it. We saved hundreds of thousands of lives and all we do is get hit on like we're terrible. And what we've done with the ventilators and with the medical equipment. And with testing, you know, testing is a double edged sword. We've tested now 25 million people. It's probably 20 million people more than anybody else. Germany's done a lot. South Korea has done a lot. They called me, they said, the job you're doing \\u2026 Here's the bad part. When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests and people don't know what's going on. We got tests, we got another one over here. The young man's 10-years-old. He's got the sniffles. He'll recover in about 15 minutes. That's a case, add him to it. That's okay. That's a case. I was actually with a very nice man, very good man, even though he's very liberal, the Governor of New Jersey, right? We know him? Now listen, he said to me, something that's amazing. New Jersey was very heavily hit, very hard hit, thousands of people. He said with thousands of people that died, thousands of people, there was only one person that died under the age of 18. Would you believe that? Which tells me one thing, that kids are much stronger than us. When you see a little kid running around say, \\\"Boy, oh, boy, do you have a great immune system? How about a piece of your immune system?\\\" They don't even know about this. Let's open the schools, please. Open the schools. Open the schools. We got to get them open. In the fall, we got to get them open. The unhinged left wing mob is trying to vandalize our history, desecrate our monuments, our beautiful monuments. Tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control. We're not conforming, that's why we're here, actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments, think of that. 00 o'clock in the morning and a very tough, I've used the word on occasion, hombre, a very tough hombre is breaking into the window of a young woman whose husband is away as a traveling salesman or whatever he may do. And you call 911 and they say, \\\"I'm sorry, this number's no longer working.\\\" By the way, you have many cases like that, many, many, many. Whether it's a young woman, an old woman, a young man or an old man and you're sleeping. So what are you going to do, right? So they want to defund. They really do, this as a serious movement. And in Minneapolis, the council's already passed it. In Seattle, you see what's going on there, it's even worse, okay. These people are stone cold crazy. They're crazy, you want to say that beautiful heritage of ours, we have a great heritage. We're a great country. You are so lucky I'm president, that's all I can tell you. People have come up to me, say, \\\"How do you take it?\\\" I say, \\\"Do I have a choice? Do I have a choice?\\\" We deal with a lot of bad people, but we're winning. And every once in a while, I'll have one of these days where I'm hit left and right, left and right, like even this great event. If you could have seen outside or if you could have heard the reports, the reports, \\\"Oh, it's COVID.\\\" It's this again. By the way, it's a disease without question, has more names than any disease in history. I can name, \\\"Kung flu.\\\" I can name, 19 different versions of names. Many call it a virus, which it is. Many call it a flu, what difference? I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the name. But they say to me, \\\"Where do you get the energy?\\\" I say, \\\"I don't have a choice. I don't have a choice.\\\" It was interesting, to show you how fake they are, you might've seen it. So last week they called me and they say, \\\"Sir, West Point, West Point, we're ready.\\\" I said, \\\"Oh, that's right. I have to make the commencement speech at West Point.\\\" Just to show you how bad the fake news is, so they say to me, \\\"Sir, we're ready to go.\\\" I say, \\\"Let's go.\\\" This is after saying hello to a lot of cadets, inspecting little areas of a building, that was very exciting. Actually, it's beautiful, very old. Studied a lot of our great generals, some of our presidents that went there. West Point is beautiful, right on the Hudson River. But after an hour, the general that runs it is a fantastic guy. After an hour, we land, we do some more inspections and they say, \\\"Sir, are you ready? Yes, I am.\\\" So we walked like the equivalent of about three blocks, which is fine. We go onstage, which is fine. They make speeches, then I make a speech that lasted a long time. I don't know, maybe 45 minutes, maybe longer, I don't know but a long time. The sun is pouring down on me, okay. But they said to me before the speech, \\\"Sir, would you like to salute each cadet, each single cadet? Or maybe there'll be in groups of two. Would you like to salute? Like this? Yes.\\\" Like this, almost 600 times. You know what that is? 600 times. Thank God they were in twos because let me tell you, you do that 600 times, you go home and you say it's like a workout without a weight, right? 600 times. So I did that. Then the incredible helicopters, brand new gorgeous helicopters, the Apaches and the other new ones that we just bought like that, but I make this speech. I salute for probably an hour and a half, maybe more, but around that. Watch. If I'm off by two minutes they'll say, \\\"He exaggerated. It was only an hour and 25 minutes. He exaggerated, he lied, he lied, he's a liar.\\\" These people are sick, the fake news. So then I finish saluting my final salute, I said, \\\"Thank goodness. Thank you very much.\\\" Think of it. So essentially almost 600 times. Now the general says, \\\"Sir, are you ready?\\\" I said, \\\"I'm ready General, where are we going now?\\\" You have to understand I left early in the morning to get there. Now it's sort of late in the afternoon. A lot of these fakers were with us. So they know. He said, \\\" Sir, we can now leave the stage.\\\" I said, \\\"Great general, let's go, I'll follow you,\\\" and he goes like this, \\\"Right here, sir,\\\" and I walked off. The stage was higher than this one and the ramp was probably 10 yards long. I say, \\\"General.\\\" Now you got to understand, I have the whole corps of cadets looking at me and I want them to love their president, I did this big thing. I love them, I love them. They're incredible, and they do. I said, \\\"General, I've got myself a problem, general.\\\" Because I'm wearing leather bottom shoes which is good if you're walking on flat surfaces. It's not good for ramps and if I fall down, look at all those press back there, look at them. This was a steel ramp, you all saw it because everybody saw it. This was a steel ramp. It had no handrail, it was like an ice skating rink, and I said, \\\"General, I have a problem,\\\" and he didn't understand that at first. I said, \\\"There's no way.\\\" He understood, I just saluted almost 600 times. I just made a big speech. I sat for other speeches. I'm being baked. I'm being baked like a cake. I said, \\\"General, there's no way I can make it down that ramp without falling on my ass, General. I have no railing.\\\" It's true. So I said, \\\"Is there like something else around?\\\" \\\"Sir, the ramp is ready to go.\\\" \\\"Grab me sir, grab me.\\\" I didn't really want to grab him. You know why? Because I said, \\\"That will be a story too.\\\" So now I have a choice. I can stay up there for another couple of hours and wait till I'm rescued or I can go down this really steep, really, really, really \\u2026 It's an ice skating rink, it's brutal. So I said, \\\"General, get ready because I may grab you so fast.\\\" Because I can't fall with the fake news watching. If I fall, if I fall, I remember when President Ford fell out of the plane, do you remember? I remember when another president, nice man, threw up in Japan, and they did slow motion replays. It's true, right? \\\"I don't want that, general.\\\" Now he's standing there, big strong guy, and he's got these shoes but they're loaded with rubber on the bottom because I looked, the first thing I did, I looked at his shoes. Then I looked at mine. Very, very slippery. So I end up saying, \\\"Okay, general, let's go. I will only grab you if I need you. That's not a good story. Falling would be a disaster. It turned out to be worse than anything, I would have been better off if I fell and slid down the damn ramp. Right? So what happens is I start the journey, inch by inch, right? I was really bent over too. I didn't like that. I didn't like this picture. This picture I'm sure will be an ad by the fakers. So I was bent over, right? Bent over like this. Then we finally reached almost the end and the fake news, the most dishonest human beings, they cut it off. You know why? Because when I was 10 feet short, I said, \\\"General, I'm sorry,\\\" and I ran down the rest, right? I looked very handsome. That was the only good. I wouldn't want to run down the whole thing because the fall there would be definitely bad. So I took these little steps, I ran down the last 10, and by the way their tape, take a look. In almost every instance, it ends just before I run, and they said, \\\"Here was the number one trending story.\\\" I call my wife, I said, \\\"How good was that speech? I thought it was a \\u2026\\\" Hey look, I will tell you when I make good ones and bad ones. Like so far tonight, I'm average, but we're having fun, we're having fun. So far tonight, but I call my wife and I said, \\\"How good was it, darling?\\\" She said, \\\"You're trending number one.\\\" I said to our great first lady, I said, \\\"Let me ask you a question. Was it that good of a speech that I'm trending number one? Because I felt it was really good.\\\" No no, they don't even mention the speech. They mention the fact that you may have Parkinson's disease. It's true. It's true. It's true. They say there is something wrong with our president. I'll let you know if there's something wrong, okay? I'll let you know if there's something, I'll tell you what, there's something wrong with Biden, that I could tell you. So then my wife said, \\\"Well it wasn't only the ramp. Did you have water?\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah. I was speaking for a long time. I didn't want to drink it, but I wanted to wet my lips a little bit.\\\" You're drinking, you're working hard up there with the sun pouring down on you. I love this location, the sun's like this. This way they save on lighting, right? That's why they did it probably. So what happens is I said, \\\"What does it have to do with water?\\\" They said, \\\"You couldn't lift your hand up to your mouth with water.\\\" I said, \\\"I just saluted 600 times like this, and this was before I saluted, so what's the problem?\\\" She said, \\\"Well I know what you did. You had on a very good red tie that's sort of expensive.\\\" It's silk because they look better. They have a better sheen to them. And I don't want to get water on the tie, and I don't want to drink much, so I lift it up, the water. It's so unfair. It really is. So unfair. They are among the most dishonest people anywhere on earth. They're bad people. Bad people. Okay, that's enough of that. I wanted to tell that story. Does everybody understand that story? The left-wing anarchists tore down a statue of Thomas Jefferson. Now we're getting into the real stuff. They decapitated a statue of Christopher Columbus, except in New York when the Italians surrounded it. They didn't have too much of a chance. Those Italians, I love the Italians. They heard they were going to rip down their beautiful Christopher Columbus and all of a sudden they circle that thing. They didn't do too well in hurting Christopher, did they? Thank you to our Italian population, we're very proud of you, right? Two days ago, leftist radicals in Portland, Oregon ripped down a statue of George Washington and wrapped it in an American flag and set the American flag on fire. Democrat, all Democrat. Everything I tell you is Democrat and you know we ought to do something, Mr. Senators, we have two great senators, we ought to come up with legislation that if you burn the American flag, you go to jail for one year. One year. Jim and James. Jim and James. We ought to do it. You know they talk about freedom of speech and I'm a big believer in freedom of speech, but that's desecration, that's a terrible thing they do. We used to have things, we don't have them anymore because we want to be so open, so everything, and look what happens? We should have legislation that if somebody wants to burn the American flag and stomp on it or just burn it, they go to jail for one year, okay? In Seattle the Democrat mayor and the Democrat city council have surrendered control of six city blocks to an anarchist \\u2026 Now these are anarchists, these are not protestors. You listen to the fake news, they say, \\\"Oh, the protesters were lovely.\\\" Could you imagine if people just even slightly to the right tried to take over Seattle? They'd have machine guns out to get them, but these people can take over the city, look at what they've done to businesspeople that have spent years and years building their business, and now they're wiped out. Take it away. Governor Inslee ought to get his act together, get in there, I'll help you, I'll do whatever you want. I'm waiting for a call, I would love to do it. I would love to do it, it'll take less than an hour and it'll all be over with and you'll have your city back. Yet Biden remains silent in his basement in the face of this brutal assault on our nation and the values of our nation. Joe Biden has surrendered to his party and to the left-wing mob. He has no control. Does anybody honestly think he controls these radial maniacs? You know what he says to his wife when he's not confusing her with his sister? \\\"Get me the hell out of there. These people are crazy.\\\" That's what he says. He has absolutely no control. You know a lot of times I'll make like a speech and I'll have this beautiful paragraph come out criticizing every little aspect of the speech, beautiful, brilliant, but Joe didn't \\u2026 It'll say, \\\"A comment from Joe Biden,\\\" but he didn't say it. Professional people, great students in English lit, people that are very smart say it. Joe Biden said, and they'll go into this highly complex paragraph, beautifully worded and I say, \\\"Joe didn't say that. Joe doesn't even understand it.\\\" wait a minute, Air Force One is 31 years old. People don't realize that. So I said, they gave me a charge, very early in my administration like how about the first week? \\\"Sir, would you sign for this plane?\\\" Now it's actually two planes. \\\"Would you sign for this plane? Air Force One?\\\" I said, \\\"How old is the original or the one we have now?\\\" \\\"Sir, it's 31, 32 years.\\\" I'd see people coming in from foreign lands that can't compete with us, rich countries but they can't compete with the \\u2026 They have a brand new beautiful 747-800, and I say, \\\"Wait a minute. That country has new and we have a 31-year, so somebody had to do \\u2026\\\". This was the Boeing before that and they were riding high, like I was before this thing came in, but we're still riding high because you know what? On November 3 we're going to win. We're going to win. So they came in and they came in and they said, \\\"No no no, we want $5.6 billion, whatever it was.\\\" Whatever it was, if I'm a little bit off they'll go crazy. Whatever, but it was a lot. $5.6 billion. Nope, got to have a three. Got to have a three, call me up. Nope, cancel the contract. I said, \\\"Cancel the contract. I want it canceled.\\\" I said, \\\"General, can you cancel the contract?\\\" He said, \\\"Yes sir, I'm very proud of it.\\\" \\\"Oh good. Cancel it.\\\" \\\"Okay sir.\\\" \\\"By the way, to cancel it, do you have to pay anything?\\\" \\\"Yes sir. We have a cancellation fee sir.\\\" \\\"How much is it, general?\\\" \\\"$250 million.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" \\\"Sir, we made a good deal. $250 million to kill.\\\" \\\"You mean if we don't buy the plane we have to hand them $250 million.\\\" That's not good, right? Look at these two guys, they're looking. By the way, that's like a good story compared to some I could tell you, like with aircraft carriers. So they said, \\\"$250 million?\\\" Or I always say this, or around that number, because if I'm off by a little bit, they say, \\\"Oh, he exaggerates.\\\" I look at numbers all day long. That's what I look at for years now, for my whole life when you think of it. $250 million cancellation fee, sir. He was very proud of himself. What a great \\u2026 I say, \\\"General. Don't cancel. Don't cancel. Just tell them I don't want the planes. Don't put anything in writing, don't put it in writing, general.\\\" \\\"Why sir?\\\" \\\"Because I don't want to pay 250.\\\" True. You hear that Jim? Jim Inhofe, he's great. You hear that Jim? You know that story. He does a great job. So here's what happened, the bottom line. Boeing says, \\\"No way, no way, no way.\\\" The next week they say, \\\"No way we're doing it.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"How about $5 billion?\\\" I said, \\\"No way. No way.\\\" The next week they said, \\\"$4.8.\\\" I said, \\\"Nope. It's got to have a 3 at the front of it. Don't you understand, you dumb son of a bitch? Don't you understand?\\\" I turned out to be right. Turned out to be right. Nobody gets that. Nope. Got to have a three. Next day, they come back, \\\"$4.5 is our best offer.\\\" \\\"Nope. I'm not doing it. I'm not doing it. Come back when you're ready.\\\" A month goes by, another month, they never heard about it, they never heard from me, they thought I was serious, I was, and they came back at $4 billion. That's a lot of money but I save like a billion six or a billion seven. Nobody wants to talk about it. Nobody wants to talk about it. When I get foreign nations to pay us billions and billions of dollars, nobody wants to talk about that. When I take soldiers out of countries because they're not treating us properly, Germany is an example. I mean I have a German heritage like some of you. I said, \\\"Let's get it down from $50,000.00 to $25,000.00 because they're delinquent. For many years they're delinquent. They haven't been paying what they're supposed to be paying. They're paying 1% instead of 2% and 2% is a very low number,\\\" and they say, \\\"Yes, we think by And they say, yes, we think by 2030, maybe 2032, we could get current. I said, \\\"No, Angela, please. Don't say that Angela. It's true. You know who I'm talking about. By the way, very nice woman. Very good negotiator. I said, \\\"Angela, that's a long time,\\\" this was in 2019. She said 2032. I said, \\\"No Angela, that's not working.\\\" But I said, because now they want to get cared, but I said, \\\"Well, what about the last 25 years? All the money you owe us?\\\" Everybody forgot about that. They forget about all the money that wasn't paid. I said, \\\"What about the trillion dollars that you really owe?\\\" So we're negotiating let's see, but in the meantime, we're reducing our troops. Remember this, we're supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia, billions of dollars for energy coming from a brand new pipeline. So they pay the country we're supposed to protect them from, they pay billions of dollars to that country. We're supposed to protect them. Excuse me, how does that work? And the great thing is with Jim Inhofe and with James Lankford, likewise, they just said they love you James. When they hear it, they get it. A lot of people don't get it. They get it. We cannot continue to be ripped off. We're ripped off by so many countries and we're stopping it. And that means that a lot of people don't want me here. They don't want me. There are a lot of people that don't want me. They don't sell a lot of bombs when we're not dropping bombs on people. You know that, right? It's called the military industrial complex. When rioting and looting broke out in our nation's Capitol, I very quickly deployed the National Guard. I said, \\\"Get them in.\\\" After watching for an evening or two, we stopped the violence and restored peace and order to the streets. And last night that had a little breakout. Again, they ripped down a statue that was 110 years old, beautiful piece of art in front of the police precinct with our radical left mayor watching on television. We're not happy. That's going to be very expensive for DC. They're always looking for money. \\\"We need more money. We always need more money.\\\" And then they don't do the proper job. So it's not going to be good for Mayor Bowser, Mayor Bowser there. They were heading over to the Jefferson Memorial recently and they wanted to do damage to our great, beautiful Jefferson Memorial. Not going to happen. Don't worry about it. We have it surrounded with very strong people. The choice in 220 is very simple. Do you want to bow before the left wing mob? Or do you want to stand up tall and proud as Americans. And explain this to the NFL. I like the NFL. I like Roger Goodell, but I didn't like what he said a week ago. I said, \\\"Where did that come from in the middle of the summer? Nobody's even asking?\\\" We will never kneel to our national anthem or our great American flag. We will stand proud and we will stand tall. I thought we won that battle with the NFL. The stadiums were emptying out. Did you see those stadiums? It took them a long time to get you back. A lot of people didn't like that. A lot of people that you wouldn't even think would care that much. I've had people that I said, \\\"These are super left liberals and they didn't like it.\\\" Joe Biden and the Democrats want to prosecute Americans for going to church, but not for burning a church. They believe you can riot, vandalize and destroy, but you cannot attend a peaceful pro-America rally. They want to punish your thought, but not their violent crimes. They want to abolish bail, abolish and open up your borders. They want open borders, let everyone, and by the way, we're doing so well. We have a record this month on the borders. Nobody's coming in. Very few people. And they want to abolish ICE, our great people from ICE who send the roughest toughest, meanest people that you've ever seen or ever heard. Generally speaking, when they have lots of tattoos on their face, they're not looking to do you much help. ICE, they're rough guys. they're great Americans, but they'll walk into, they caught them in a pack. They'll walk into a pack of tough MS-13 gang members. And we shouldn't say this, it's not nice. They want us to negotiate. They start swinging. And the other such way, everybody's swinging, at the end, they carry them back and they throw them into the paddy wagon. They're great. And these people want to get rid of ICE. They get rid of murderers. They get rid of rapists. They get rid of the worst scum on earth. And when I called them animals, I said, \\\"They're animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi, they cut up a young woman. They cut up a young woman and her friend, cut them up with a knife because it was more painful. Dead. Cut them up with a knife because it's more painful. It takes longer than shooting a gun. They cut them up. I said, \\\"These are animals.\\\" And Nancy Pelosi said, \\\"These are human beings. They're not animals.\\\" If I lose an election over that, you know what? This country is in big trouble. They want to disarm law, abiding citizens and dismantle our police forces while freeing vicious MS-13 gang members. In Joe Biden's America, rioters, looters, and criminal aliens have more rights than law abiding citizens. And that's true. In my administration, we defend American citizens and we deport MS-13 members or put them in jail if we have to. The chaos you're seeing in our democratic run cities, these are all run by the Democrats, is what will happen in every city and community and America, and much, much worse if we don't keep them out. We have to do this. We have to go to the polls on November 3rd and the rest of you know what to do. You know what to do. Got to keep the White House. Joe Biden's record can be summed up as four decades of betrayal, calamity, and failure. He never did anything. He was a Senator. He was a Vice President. He was before that something. You know what's great? President. Trump was tough on this or he was tough. They complained, never did anything about it. He's been there for 43 years or 47 years. He never did anything about it. Biden's supported every globalist attack on the American worker let's make every country of the world rich but ourselves, including NAFTA, the disaster of NAFTA. He wanted to go and TPP would have ruined our automobile industry. Korea, I renegotiated the deal. I took a horrible deal. That was a Hillary Clinton special. That was a Hillary Clinton special. She said, \\\"We have to make this deal with South Korea. It's going to mean 250,000 jobs.\\\" And she was right for South Korea, 250,000. And China's entry into the World Trade Organization was supported by sleepy Joe Biden. That was one of the worst deals economically in the history of our country. When China joined the World Trade Organization, they were flat line for decades. They became like a rocket ship. He voted for the war in Iraq. He voted for mass amnesty for illegal aliens. He supports sanctuary cities and now Biden wants to end immigration enforcement and he wants to require you to provide free healthcare for millions and millions of illegal aliens. When I took early and decisive action to ban travel from China and protect Americans from the virus. And as I said, Joe Biden, opposed my decision and called it hysteria, xenophobia. He doesn't know what the word means, xenophobia and fear-mongering. And then he apologized a month later. He said he was wrong, but he didn't say it. And they didn't cover it. They didn't cover it. On one of the single most important policy decisions of our lifetime, Joe Biden sided with China over America, that's closing the border. He thought it was a terrible thing. Remember, this was in January. That's early, real, early, the end of January. He thought it was a terrible thing. When we close the border. Too many people that were badly infected with COVID. When the chips are down, Biden will always cave to the radical left. He'll always bow to the angry mob and he will never protect you or your family and you know that. Joe Biden will always let you down. That's been his history. At my direction early this year, the heroes of the U.S. military took out the world's top terrorist, the savage killer leader of ISIS al-Baghdadi and the number one terrorist, anywhere in the world, Qasem Soleimani. We took them out. Joe Biden opposed killing Soleimani. He was vehemently\\u2026 We killed this number one, terrorist. He didn't like it. You know why he didn't like it? Because he thought it would be good politically, that didn't work out too well. Just as he opposed the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. He opposed it, you know that. Biden is always on the wrong side of history, as said by people that are with him and worked with him. He never made a correct foreign policy decision. Biden is a puppet for China. Son walked out with 1.5 billion. I think it's a little bit\\u2026 Allowing them to rip off America for many years. Now they're paying us billions and billions of dollars. We give a lot of it to our farmers. We have plenty leftover. China is not exactly happy with me. They pay us billions and billions of dollars. And they targeted our great farmers. And I took the money that they targeted, I took that money and I gave it to the farmers. So they were even so they're okay. Are you okay? Come, Doctor, please. Doctor. Thank you. These people some of the people are waiting for five days, especially in this location. You take your time, darling, take your time. Thank you very much. Take your time. Doctor, thank you, doctor. Some people wait for four or five days. That's incredible. He never did anything against China, Joe Biden. And that's why they desperately want him to win. They want him to win so badly. Iran wants him to win so badly. Let me tell you, I'm going to make a very fast deal. The best deal you've ever seen. I've already made one with China, but I can make even more. They want me to lose because they will own the United States if I lose. Iran. President Obama gave them $150 billion for nothing. I told them. And look what happened to Biden in Ukraine where his son's paid $83,000 a month. And he was jobless. Give me a break. $83,000 a month. More than anybody. If Joe Biden were to become president an emboldened left, will launch a full scale assault on American life. You know that. They'll expel anyone who disagrees with them. Look what happens when you disagree. You use a term that's perfect and they're not happy with it. They call you a racist. They call you a horrible person. They want to crush religious liberty. They don't want religion. Silence religious believers, indoctrinate your children with hateful and vicious lies about our country, subsidize late term abortion and after birth execution. They want to take away your guns through the repeal of your Second Amendment, as sure as you're sitting there. In fact, he even put the big gun grabber, Beto O'Rourke, who made a fool out of himself when he ran for president. They put him in charge of guns. Lots of luck on your Second Amendment. Just remember I said, and hopefully you won't have to think back about it too much, because it won't matter. Hopefully it won't matter. No, Beto O'Rourke who wants to give up guns is in charge of the second amendment. The Dems will also eliminate private health insurance, ban fracking, that's not good, and American energy will be in a position of weakness like it's never been before. And that's after we built the greatest energy country anywhere in the world by far. And they want to appoint Supreme Court justices who will utterly obliterate your Constitution. And you now see how important the Supreme Court is. Think if we didn't have two justices, that I think have been very, very, very good, but think how important it is. Think how important it is. And we still, I guess it's a, I don't know if it's an equal court, it's almost like we're a minority court, right? It's almost like we're a minority court. The recent Supreme Court cases prove that if Joe Biden is elected, he will stack the court with extremists, the forgotten men and women, together with everyone else. We'll lose everything. The forgotten men and women, I campaigned on the forgotten. These are great people. These are substantial people. These are the elite. By the way, you're the elite. They're not the elite. You're the elite. Somebody two days ago said, \\\"Sir, the elite are really working hard on trying to destroy you.\\\" I said, \\\"Yeah, why do you call them the elite,\\\" I said, \\\"why?\\\" \\\"Well, they're not elite.\\\" I look better than them. Much more handsome. Got better hair than they do. I got nicer properties. I got nicer houses. I got nicer apartments. I got nicer everything. I ran for politics once, just once in my life. And I became President of the United States. And hopefully if you get out and vote, we'll do it one more time. We won't even toy with them about three or four more times. We won't. We'll do it one more time. We'll be two for two. And our country will never, ever be stronger. But I'll be soon announcing a new list of exceptional candidates for the United States Supreme Court. And I'll choose only from that list. A hundred percent, probably 25 incredible people, any one of which could be a great justice, any one of which. And I did it last time and people loved when I did it. And I'll only pick from that list. Biden can't release his list because the names would be too extreme, too radical. They wouldn't be acceptable, but they will be very radical people. People don't understand, but we actually won on DACA yesterday. We actually won because they basically said, \\\"You won, but you have to come back and redo it.\\\" It's almost like, \\\"Gee, come on back, your paperwork was no good.\\\" But we're going to be refiling, but don't let it get you. Everything's going to work out really good. Everything's going to work out good. It was a great, it was great. I mean, would have been nice if we won. And Everybody said, \\\"Oh, you're going to win DACA. You're going to win DACA. That's easy. You got to win DACA. That's easy.\\\" They all said it. And they came back and they said, \\\"We don't like what you did with your paperwork,\\\" essentially. So we're re-filing it. Most people would say we lost. We didn't lose. We're going to refile it. And everything is going to work out for the young people. Most of whom aren't so young anymore, by the way. But we're going to work it out for everybody. Biden is fully controlled by the fringe of his party. He is their pawn. He doesn't even know where the hell he is. Let's face it. He installed socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. To be in charge of his environmental policy and his energy. Energy, you can forget petroleum. How does Oklahoma feel about being petroleum free? Not good, right? Our country will have no energy. Our country will have nothing. Oklahoma, Texas, North Dakota, and many others will all be out of business. I don't think that's going to work out too well, but she's actually in charge of environmental policy. And you know what that means. She doesn't even want to win. She doesn't want those bird killing machines that go round and round. You want to see a lot of birds that are dead? Go under a windmill sometime. She wants us to go back to the stone ages because she's got no sense, no credentials. She's got a little charisma, not much, but she doesn't have a clue. You know it. But she's in charge of the environment. No airplanes. We can forget Boeing, I guess, come to think of it. We talked about Boeing. We could forget Boeing. Let's cancel those brand new Air Force Ones. Likewise, Representative Ilhan Omar is going to be very much involved in a Biden government. They will put this hate filled America, bashing socialist, front and center in deciding the fate of your family and deciding the fate of your country. I don't think she would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came, Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing. Just anarchy. And now she's telling us how to run our country. No thank you. And I think we're going to have a big victory in the state of Minnesota, because they've had it. They've had it. Biden is a very willing Trojan horse for socialism. When Biden first ran for president over 33 years ago, remember I used to call him 1% Joe, he never got more than 1% until Obama took him off the trash heap. But he blatantly copied the speech of a British politician, even ripping off the man's personal biography and family history and claiming it was his own. He forgot to say he was born in America. Joe Biden is a shameless hypocrite. Since 2003, he has delivered fawning eulogies to the funeral. And at those funerals of three leading supporters of segregation, including a former member of the KKK, and yet Biden is now smearing as racist, tens of millions of people like yourselves. Decent, hardworking Americans who he's never met. And he frankly probably doesn't want to meet. America should not take lectures on racial justice from Joe Biden. Sleepy Joe. A man who praised and partnered with segregationists, shift millions of black American jobs overseas, and everyone else's jobs too by the way. If I didn't come along, we're building auto plants, we're building everything. And there's never been a comeback like we're making right now. Never been. He hollowed out our middle class, including our black middle class with open borders. Trapped young children in failing government schools, built cages. Those cages were built by Obama and Biden. Look it up, 2014. And the fake news doesn't wanted to\\u2026 Remember the picture of the cage? A cage for children. Remember the picture of the cage. And they said President Trump. And then they realized that was at a newspaper, 2014, the same\\u2026 Built by Obama and Biden, the cages. And they don't- And they don't want to report the way it is. They know the way it is. They're not stupid. They sent young boys to fight in Iraq while the inner cities crumble, helped the big banks while hammering community leaders, and made our cities less safe and secure for all. They've done a terrible job and they shouldn't be awarded. They should not get rewarded with an election victory on November 3rd, that shouldn't happen. It'll destroy this country. Our country will be destroyed. We've all worked too hard. They don't know what the hell they're doing. Some do actually, but in a very sinister way. Virtually every policy that has hurt black Americans for half a century, Joe Biden has supported or enacted. I've done more for the black community in four years than Joe Biden has done in 47 years. Racial justice begins with Joe Biden's retirement from public life. We are joined tonight by many outstanding Republican leaders. These are great people. We have two of our most distinguished, hardworking, wonderful friends, senators. They do a great job. Senator Jim Inhofe and James Lankford, please stand up. Two very respected, I will tell you, two very respected people in Washington. They're respected by everybody. They do some job, and I'd have you come up, but you can relax. I will say this. Jim is running on November 3rd, Jim Inhofe. He's running on November 3rd. I don't even know. Does he\\u2026 Hey, James? Does he have any competition? Is somebody actually running against\\u2026 There's no competition that he's got. I know he's got James' support. He's got my support. I give him 100% endorsement. Jim Inhofe. I'd give it to James too, but he's not running this time. Thank you. Jim, great job. Thank you very much. What a great Senator he is. Also here is a man who's respected by so many. He's a little bit right of the people we've been talking about tonight. Senator Tom Cotton of the great state of Arkansas. Thank you, Tom. They like you people. Thank you, Tom. Great job you're doing. We're glad to be joined as well by a man that I've gotten to know. He's done an incredible job with COVID and with everything else he touches, Governor Kevin Stitt. Thank you both. Thank you both for being here. Thank you. Lieutenant Governor Matt Pinnell. Thanks, Matt. Thanks, Matt. And Representatives Frank Lucas, Tom Cole. He's been here for a little while. He's done an incredible job. Markwayne Mullin, you don't want to fight with him. I want to put him and Jim Jordan in a match together, I want to. Kevin Hern, great job today, Kevin. The great Jim Jordan, Jim Jordan. Elise Stefanik. Lee Zeldin. Tom Emmer. Tom, thank you. These are warriors, folks. These are great warriors. During the fake impeachment trial, I'll tell you what. There was nobody that could have done the job they've done. That includes the Senate and the House. These people are incredible. David Kustoff. David. A great friend of mine. Debbie Lesko, Arizona. Great job, Debbie. Great job. And a man who's got very good genes, Greg Pence. Thank you all. Great job. They're great\\u2026 They are, they're warriors. I'll tell you what. Not every person is, but this group is, and we have a lot of them in Washington, and we'll send Jim Inhofe back, and we'll send all of them. You'll send every one of them. They have to come back because they have been fighting for us, and they've been fighting for you. And they are just incredible, talented, tough, strong people that love your state a lot. So thank you very much. So we built the greatest single economy in the world. And then we say not only the world, but actually in the history of the world, and they never even challenged me. So I guess I'm right. We did it. We had the best numbers anybody's ever had. We have the best employment numbers, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, the best employment numbers in history, the best stock market numbers in history. We were the envy of the world. Everybody would come in to see me, presidents, prime minister, kings, queens, and dictators. Dictators would even come in to say congratulations on the economy. And then the plague came in, and now what we're doing is we're doing it again. And it's going fast. We have to have a lot of it done because people don't quite get it. We're doing record business. It's happening at a level and a speed that nobody can believe. Two weeks ago, job numbers came in the single biggest number in the history of our country. Last week, retail sales numbers came in, retail sales, the single greatest number in the history of our country. So here's what's going to happen. Here's what's going to happen. They blame a President for anything. When you see looters, even though we put them down, if we didn't stop them, nobody would because the other side will never stop them. But they always blame a President. Here's what's happening. We're going up. We're going up. We're going up. We're going to go up. Then we're going to hit October. We're going to be up. We're going to be way up. We're not going to be where we were, but in many ways, other than all of the horrible, horrible death that was so needlessly caused by a virus that should have been stopped where it originated, which was China. But we're going to go up, up, up, up August, September, October, and people are going to say, \\\"Man, this guy is doing a good job. He knows what he's doing. I don't believe the fake news anymore.\\\" And you're not going to want to lose your 401k's. And you're not going to want to lose all of that wealth that you've accumulated, whether it's real estate wealth or any wealth you can think because it'll all come tumbling down if these people are put in charge. And if they double and triple and quadruple your taxes, it will be a whole different ball game. So I'm not putting any pressure on anybody, but in the end, we're going to have a phenomenal economy. And next year we're going to have a good third quarter, but next year, and I said it before, will be the single greatest year economically that we've ever had, okay? And if you see that happening, if you see it happening on November 3rd, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. You, even you, you don't have the guts to vote against Trump. Say, \\\"Wait a minute, darling. My 401k is higher than it was the last time. I don't think I want to take a chance.\\\" You're not going to want to do that. The stock market has been the best. Think of this, go back one week and go back 50 days. In that 50 day period, it's the strongest 50 days in the history of the stock market, think of it. And your wife or your husband says, \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You are such a great investor.\\\" And all you did is just keep the same crap you had the first time, right? \\\"Darling, I love you so much. You've always been a loser. You've always lost money. But now under President Trump, you're one of the greatest financial minds in our country.\\\" And all you did was keep your stock? What's wrong with having these great economic numbers? What's wrong with having to close it down? We saved millions of lives. You know, a lot of people say we should have gone herd, let's go herd. Ask them how are they doing in Brazil. He's a great friend of mine, not good. You heard about Sweden, right? Too much. Ask them how they do it in Sweden. We saved millions of lives, and now it's time to open up, get back to work, okay? Get back to work. I recently signed groundbreaking criminal justice reform. I secured record and permanent funding for historically black colleges and universities. We slashed regulations and passed massive tax cuts to give black workers a pay raise like they've never, ever gotten before and lift up black owned businesses. And I worked closely with a great senator also, friend of theirs, Senator Tim Scott, South Carolina, to create opportunity zones, which are doing incredibly. And since then countless jobs and $100 billion of new investment, not government investment, have poured into 9,000 of our most distressed neighborhoods anywhere in the country. 9,000, never happened before. Tim Scott. Today. I'm also announcing that I have directed Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt to place the John Hope Franklin Reconciliation Park here in Tulsa on the African American Civil Rights Network. So many of my friends have been asking me to do that. So many of my friends, including these great politicians. So we're going to do that. It'll be done very quickly. We will forever remember and honor the courageous people who helped build this state and this country. Democrats are stoking division in order to distract from their decades of failure on schools, jobs, housing, justice, and crime. In major city public schools run by Democrats, over two thirds of students are falling behind in reading and math. And I think the numbers are worse than that. But Democrats would rather deny these children the future they deserve than allow them to attend the charter, public, private, religious, or independent schools of their choice. Pro choice, pro choice. Pro choice for schools. It's very popular, but some people it's like a disaster because what it does to certain unions that have a lot of power over the Democrats, even though they know it's wrong. Republicans believe access to education is a civil right. It's a civil rights. 20 of 20 of the most dangerous cities in America are controlled by Democrats. Think of that, 20 of 20. And so is nearly every major city with a child poverty rate that's over 30%. They're controlled by Democrats. We can name every one of them. The murder rate in Baltimore and Detroit is higher than El Salvador, Guatemala, or even Afghanistan. How are they doing, the Democrats running those cities? Your whole country will be like that. In 2018 alone, our police arrested nearly 12,000 people for murder and manslaughter, 25,000 people for rape, and nearly 1.5 million for assault, violent assault. The Democrats' push against our police will drive up crime and drive up costs at levels you'd never believe. Thousands of innocent lives will be lost. As President, I will always support the incredible men and women of law enforcement. A vote for Republicans is a vote for better schools, better jobs, safer families, and stronger communities for all Americans. There is a limit to what we can together achieve with four more years. With your help, we will lift millions of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. That's what's happening, that's what's happening. And that was happening at a level that nobody ever thought they'd see, it was happening before this COVID came in. It was happening at a level that nobody believed possible. And then China sent us the plague, thank you very much. We will protect Medicare and Social Security for our great seniors. And we'll always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always, always. We will appoint more judges to interpret the Constitution as written. We will end deadly sanctuary cities. We will finish the wall, which has now 212 miles built and beautiful. 212 mile. That's a lot of miles. And let me tell you, you think that was an easy one, that was a tough one. That party was totally unified against building the wall. You know, in the end they gave up, you know what happened? They realized it was a bad issue for them because these open borders. I love when they fight for open borders because anybody that wants an open border coming in from rough areas, there's something wrong with those people. So did you notice in the end it was like, \\\"Just leave us alone, build your wall, just leave us alone.\\\" I said, \\\"Thank you very much.\\\" And we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration that puts American workers first. We will revitalize our cities, and we will build gleaming new roads, bridges, tunnels, and airports all across our land. We will enact new trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, Made in the USA. It's so beautiful, so beautiful. Made in the USA. That's happening too. We have so many plants coming into Michigan and so many other states. We have car plants coming in would have never come if I wasn't President, would have never come. We will become the world's premier pharmacy, drug store, and medical manufacturer. That's already started. We're bringing it back. We will keep America out of foolish, stupid, ridiculous foreign wars. We will never hesitate to kill America's terrorist enemies. When I took over, ISIS was all over the place, and I did something that I felt we should do. And we have now obliterated, we have now captured 100% of the ISIS caliphate. 100, 100. And like our depleted military when I took over, like our empty shelves, medically, when I took over, like all of the things that when I took over, it was a mess, we have done a job. You had to see what ISIS was doing. They were getting bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. I came in, smaller, smaller, smaller. \\\"Sir, we've just taken 100%.\\\" We will launch a new age of American ambition in space. And the United States will be the first nation to land on Mars, good program. You saw the beautiful rocket three weeks ago go up, beautiful. We will defend privacy, free thought, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And when you see those lunatics all over the streets, it's damn nice to have arms. Damn nice. Interesting how all of a sudden people understand it, right? You couldn't sell it. Now people understand it. The right to keep and bear arms, we'll protect your second amendment. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one America, we will support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We uphold the principle of equal justice under the law. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always salute our great American flag. And we live by the words of our national motto, it will never change, \\\"In God we trust.\\\" We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, dug out the Panama Canal, laid down the railroads, revolutionized industries. Won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And we are making it greater and greater every single day. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning the power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. America will soon be thriving, like never before because, ladies and gentlemen of Oklahoma, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again, we will make America strong again, we will make America proud again, we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you. Thank you, Oklahoma. Thank you.\",\n          \"Hello Colorado. We love Colorado, most beautiful place And I'm thrilled to be back in Colorado Springs. I've spent a lot of time here over the years. Beautiful place, beneath the majestic peaks, that's true, of the Rocky Mountains with thousands of terrific, hardworking, great American patriots. With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide. And you're going to help us get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100%. there was no waiver. He's been with us. There was no waiver with Corey. We appreciate it. Thank you Corey. Thank you. This month we mark a very special anniversary. 75 years ago this week our brave United States Marines landed on the shores of Iwo Jima and began one of the bloodiest battles of the second world war. It was a rough one. Tonight it's our great privilege to be joined by three of the heroes of the Battle of Iwo Jima, James Blaine, Donald Whipple and John Thurman. Great, great patriots, very brave people. Just passed away. Sadly he passed away just a few days ago. He was going to be here. Passed away a few days ago, but he was great. I have a beautiful picture of him right outside and we're going to honor him and his family. Great, great gentlemen. So we were going to have four. We have three and we want to thank you for being here. Thank you all. Thank you. Because America is truly a land of heroes, on behalf of the grateful nation I would like to recognize the many veterans of the Vietnam War and the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars who are here this evening, and a lot of them. Great people, great people. This is a truly incredible time for America. We have the best economy in our history, the most prosperity of any country. We are doing better than any country in the world, that is not even close. And we've rebuilt our military over the last three years. Don't tell anybody, but we spent two and a half trillion dollars. But when it comes to our military and our safety and our security, we don't worry about budgets, right? We don't worry about budgets. We had to rebuild it. It was depleted. It was in bad shape. It was old, it was tired. We have the best people in the world, but they had old equipment. Now we have brand new jets. We have brand new missiles and rockets. We have everything all made in the USA. In my State of the Union Address, I proudly declared that we are in the midst of the great American comeback. That's what we're doing. Our country is stronger today than ever before. After three years of ridiculous witch hunts and scams and partisan Democrat crusades, the radical left's attempt to poison our democracy and overturn this last election have totally failed. They have been a complete flop and we today have the highest poll numbers we've ever had today, just came out. And I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate, it got very big ratings and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do well last night. I was going to send him a note saying it's not easy doing what I do, is it? It's not easy, Mike. Not easy for any of them. Now, Mike didn't do too well. He went way down. It's all right. Mini mike. How about Klobuchar, did you see her? She choked. She choked. She couldn't breathe. Alfred E. Neuman looked at her and said something slightly derogatory and she said, \\\"Are you accusing me of being dumb?\\\" Who would make a statement like that? Because that's really what he was doing, but he doesn't want to say that. No, how about that? \\\"Are you saying I'm dumb?\\\" That was the end of her campaign in my book. You don't say that. Even if it's true, you don't say that. They had a crazy person on today on one of the Fox shows. I tell you, Fox doesn't treat us the way they used to. But we have the great Sean Hannity, we do, and we have Laura and Tucker. And we have in the morning Fox and Friends, Steve and Ainsley, and Brian's gotten much better, he's moving up. And we have the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs says he's the greatest president ever. The great Lou Dobbs. He says, Lou Dobbs a year and a half, two years ago he said, \\\"He's the greatest since Reagan.\\\" Then he said about six months ago, \\\"He's better than Reagan.\\\" And then he said a few nights ago, \\\"He's the greatest we've ever had.\\\" I said, \\\"Does that include Lincoln and George Washington?\\\" He said, \\\"That includes them all.\\\" That's Lou Dobbs. The great Lou Dobbs. And you've got Hegseth and you've got Jesse Waters. How about Jesse? And Judge Jeanine and even Greg Gutfeld. Greg hated us, right? But now he says, \\\"Look, whether I like him or not, he gets it done. It's all about getting it done.\\\" We're getting it done. Nobody's ever done what we've done. No, but Fox says, and I don't know, it's different. It was different. In the old days, it was better for us. It was better for us. But it's okay, we'll win anyway. No, but they had this woman on. Neil Cavuto, doesn't treat us good. Neil Cavuto, he's not too good. She said, \\\"I don't like him.\\\" Nobody likes him. Right now\\u2026 So you had, remember Lest in The Readies? You remember who was Lest in The Readies? He got fired, right? You remember, right? Remember? He's gone and now Neil's taking his place. Neil is actually a nice guy, but he doesn't like Trump too much. And he put this woman on today and she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates and he won,\\\" because she was referring to Mike Bloomberg, sometimes referred to as Mini Mike. And I said, \\\"Wait a minute, I won every debate.\\\" It's true. And we sent them polls, poll after poll after poll. Not only won them, but won by a lot. I won every debate. I'm just saying every poll, they do those polls right after, three, four, 500,000 people, Time Magazine. I said, \\\"Nobody's allowed to do that. You can't do that.\\\" We're at enough of a disadvantage with the fake news. They make up 90% of the story. So where is Dan Scavino? Where is Scavino? Does anyone know who Dan Scavino is? Dan, bring me those pages up here. Bring those pages up. See if you can get them. Go get them. It's such fake news. It's so disgusting. You know what? They'd do better if they told the truth. Do you agree? They'd do better. Oh, someday in 10, 14, 18, 22 years when I'm gone, when we leave office in 26 years or so, they're going to miss us. I told the story that a month before I ran, 2016 I was thinking about it. I said to my wife, who has become a great First Lady. People love here. They said it's one of the greatest fields ever assembled. And I said, \\\"What the hell should I run for if they are so great?\\\" But I remember holding up the New York Times and it was like a leaflet that you give a certain, a supermarket, right? It's like, the thing was blowing in the wind. It was dead and now it's successful again. But when we leave, it's all of us. We leave together. We're unified. This is the most unified the Republican party has ever been. And when we leave, the New York Times\\u2026 Thank you. The great Dan Scavino, the most powerful man in politics. Hey Dan. So Zuckerberg left. Who is number one in the world on Facebook? And I'm saying this in front of the fake news because if I'm wrong, they're going to report me, right? Who is number one in the world on Facebook? He walked in, but that's us. He walked in for\\u2026 We had dinner recently just because I want them to pay taxes. I want to find out what's going on. But he walked in, he's smart, and he said, \\\"I just want to congratulate you.\\\" Small dinner, a few people. He said, \\\"You're number one in the world in Facebook.\\\" I said, \\\"That's nice.\\\" I said, \\\"Who's number two?\\\" He said, \\\"Prime minister Modi of India.\\\" I said, \\\"Wait a minute, wait a minute. He's got 1.5 billion people and we have 350 so he should be number one.\\\" But we're never going to give up that position of number one in the world for our country, for Facebook, for Twitter, for anything, and they still haven't figured it out. They have not figured it out. But look at all that press. Look at all that press. Did this ever happen before? And then you have Brad Pitt. I was never a big fan of his. He got upset. A little wise guy statement. A little wise guy. He's a little wise guy. Anyway, but we're doing what? Over here, I just showed this real quick. Right? So this horrible journalist, she's a real, she's a Trump hater. You know what she's worth? Zero ratings. Nobody watches her, but she said\\u2026 she was trying to\\u2026 Look, Bloomberg made a fool out of himself last night. He choked. He's another one who's going, \\\" Oh I can't breathe. I can't breathe. Don't ask me the question, please.\\\" I look at my wife, I said, \\\"Let's send him a little note. It's not so easy up there to do what I did, right?\\\" Not so easy. But this woman who is a third rate, fourth rate, she's been with everybody. Every year she's with a different group, but I won't use her name because it'll make her too famous. It actually plays to their advantage. But she's third rate and she's on the lowest rated show at Fox, Neil Cavuto. That's why. So she said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't get good ratings. He didn't do well in the polls.\\\" She said, \\\"He didn't do well on the debates.\\\" She said that we were defeated in the debates. Well I defeated crooked Hillary every time and by a lot. Yeah, she's crooked as a $3 bill. I was going, \\\"Whatever happened to the 33,000 emails? Whatever happened?\\\" 33,000, she deleted them and her acid washed them and she didn't get in trouble. Can you imagine if a Republican did that? They would want to bring back the death penalty, right? Two standards. But I think things are happening. I said drain the swamp, I just never knew how deep it was. We have more garbage in the swamp than you would ever believe. And this is part of the swamp. So what happens? She said, \\\"Donald Trump didn't do well in the debates.\\\" Now remember my answer, Rosie O'Donnell, right? First question I've ever, and we took down the house. Then the second, Brett Barry asked me, I had to raise the hand. I'm the only one, I guess that raised the hand. Right? And the place went crazy because I was the only one telling the truth. Okay? Turns out I was the only one telling\\u2026 And the people get it. But she said I didn't do well on the bench. I said, \\\"Really? I won every single debate.\\\" We had 15 to 14 debates, then we had the presidential debates with crooked Hillary against myself. So here's one. I don't want to\\u2026 I'm a little guilty because these are all my friends, right? A lot of them are my friends now. They weren't my friends then, they were my mortal enemy. It's hard to be friends when you're competing against somebody. You're right about that. So here's Donald Trump, 67. The next one was 13%. the next one was 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, 2%, 2%, 1%, 1%, and 0. All right, that's Time Magazine. All right, that's Time. They don't like me. I don't like them either, by the way. Although actually I do like the new owner. This year I got beaten out by Gretta. You know Gretta? Last year I got beaten out\\u2026 I mean, I've won it. But when the world evolves around all of us, we should be chosen. There's nothing wrong with it, right? I mean, we've won it, but we should win it every single year, let's face it. And now they call it person of the year. They don't go out man of the year. And I know the women out there are saying, \\\"Isn't that nice?\\\" But a lot of the women out there don't like it. They don't like it. We could have a woman of the year and a man of the year. I like that. Okay, here's Drudge Report. Drudge is starting to treat me good again. He started to like me again. I like him. Look, Trump and Ted Cruz, I can say he came in second. He was a great debater. And Marco came in third and a guy who I don't like much and they don't like him much in Ohio either, Kasich. Kasich. He was way down. Way down. Okay, look who won? Trump. Here's another one. Look again, a different one, Time Magazine. Trump, 33%. Ben Carson, good man, he was down. Marco, Jed, Ted. Carly Fiorina, a name I haven't heard in a long time. What happened to Carly? And ran, good poll. Here's the story. Look, but way up. Way up. Look at this. Here's another one. Look at this. Trump 46%. I didn't make this up. Here's another one. This is a different debate. I don't know. They're all different. I won every one of them. Look, Trump, I just took these at random, 46%. second, 5%, 3%, 5%, 3%, 9%, 5%, 11%. Trump, 46%. Here's another one, CNBC. Well, the market's been up. They've actually been not so bad and Joe Kiernan is a good guy. He is a good guy. Some of the rest, I don't care for it too much. Becky's like, she plays it a little bit down in the middle, right? Which is okay. Trump, almost 50%. Then they have all the rest of them. 14, 4, 3, 2, 2.8, 2.54, 1.9, I'm not going to give you the names. I won't tell you that I got 48.8 and Jeb Bush got 1.1. The rest I'm not going to talk about, but he hasn't been exactly a great supporter, sort of a never Trumper I guess. So Jeb, 1.9, 1.1, and Trump 48. That's another one. Oh, here's a nice one. Here's a nice one. Look at this. Look at this. Trump 70%, next one is 18%, next one is 7, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, 1. Trump didn't do well in the debate. See, they're fake news. Here's another one, Trump Kicked Ass. Trump Kicked Ass. Trump 48, number two was six. Here's another one. Trump 75.6, crooked Hillary was 24%. This was against crooked Hillary. So look at that. Trump was 74.6, crooked Hillary Clinton was 24.1. Trump was 80%, crooked Hillary was 18%. And I've got this woman. You know who it is, right? Nobody knows the name. I'm not going to mention it. But everybody knows Neil Cavuto. She has no credibility and neither do you, Neil Cavuto. Here's another one. Crooked Hillary, and by the way, one is a Fox poll, one is Breitbart, one is a Drudge report. One is a Patch, one is Syracuse.com, one is Pollack Opinion, Alyssa Goodwin. But look at these numbers. Trump 92. What is it? So I'm winning every poll, I beat crooked Hillary. Here's the one, Trump 61, crooked Hillary 39. Okay? That's what it is. And then I turn on the damn show on Fox. Again, it's not the same. It was much better. It really was. It was much better. I turn on Fox and I've got this third rate political journalist, if you call her that saying, \\\"Trump did very poorly in the debates, but he became president.\\\" No, I did great in the debates. I became president because of the debates, because unlike Mini Mike, I could answer questions. And here's the final one and I could get you another 15. These are all the ones that taken right after. People call in, hundreds of thousands of people, they call in Time Magazine, CNBC. So here's a CNBC, crooked Hillary Clinton, 39%. Donald Trump, 61%. and then this stupid person said I didn't debate well. Now look, I don't mind and you can have bad debates, but I won every single debate. Listened to this, then three and a half, four years later I have to listen to a person saying how we didn't do well, because these people are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world. Take it. Take it. Here it is. Okay, let's get back to business. Now I feel good. Now I feel good. She's a third rate journalist. Let's go. We're standing up in defense of our constitution, our freedom and democracy itself, right? While the extreme left has been wasting America's time and doing all sorts of vial hoaxes, we went through hoaxes. We went through the impeachment scam. And by the way, Corey was with us all the way. He didn't move. He didn't budge. He said it's a lot of bull. He said it's a lot of bull. But while they're doing that stuff and we're working with a cloud, we're working with these people. They want to take you out. They want to change the results. They got caught spying, let's say it like it is, right? They got caught spying on our election. Fake news. Hey fake news, take your cameras for a change and show them the room and show them behind you. Go ahead, show them the room. Show them the room. You see, they never do it, including Fox, by the way. Fox is not that much better. We just got lucky because we have some\\u2026 All their high rated shows are the shows that like Trump, all their losers shows like Cavuto are the shows that don't like Trump. How is Shep Smith doing lately, by the way? How is Shep Smith? He had the lowest ratings and now Cavuto took his place so that's okay. But they never show the room. My wife, a great First Lady, she goes\\u2026 I say, \\\"Hi honey. Did you watch the debate?\\\" \\\"Yeah.\\\" \\\"How did the room look? Was that\\u2026\\\" because last night I think we turned away 21,000 people. We had an arena that it held 12, but we fill up the basketball courts, right? Or the ice rink. We had to have 15, 16,000 people. It was on fire. You all saw it. It was great. And she said to me, she said, \\\"Darling, how did you do?\\\" I said, \\\"I did great.\\\" I said, \\\"Did you see the arena?\\\" And she said, \\\"No, they never show the arena.\\\" You know that guy Dana White at UFC? I won't tell you about him yet, but he's a brilliant guy, right? I mean, he sold his crazy fighters, I mean bomb bomb bomb. $4 billion he got with Fertittas, great people. But you know what? They're always showing it's full. It's full. These fakers back there, they don't want people. But I'll tell you what my wife said, \\\"They don't show it, but you can't imitate 15,000 people when it comes to the noise.\\\" Look, they won't show it. They never show it and we've never had an empty seat from the day I came down the escalator, not one. What these guys do if Mr. And Mrs. Jones sitting right up there, beautiful couple. If she said, \\\"Darling, I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do about it, darling. I have to go to the bathroom.\\\" He said, \\\"Darling, I'll walk with you.\\\" The cameras glong on to those seats, they glong on and they say, \\\"There were two empty seats. Trump didn't fill up the room.\\\" These are the worst people. But when I told them to spin around those cameras, they stayed that way. Now, if we had a protestor somewhere in the arena, it could be up in that corner where it's loaded up with people, those cameras that can do, they look like a pretzel. They look like a pretzel. They want to find it. There's trouble, those same guys could, it could cover anything. I used to think, well it's the equipment, it's very rigid. They can't turn it. And then some idiot from up in the corner starts screaming stupid stuff, because that's dangerous in this room, to be honest. We don't have it too much. They only pick on the guys that are all by themselves and aren't fighters. But if somebody up there does something, those cameras turn around, spin around like a pretzel. They bend, boom, they get. So that was the end of my theory that we have rigid equipment. And by the way, I told them, turn around, not one of those cameras turned around to show the room because it's fake news. While the extreme left has been wasting America's time with vial hoaxes, we've been killing terrorists, creating jobs, raising wages, enacting fair trade deals, securing our border and lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, right? We added another 225,000 brand new beautiful jobs last month, way, way, way above what our great geniuses back there thought it would be, 225,000. Think of it, we right now have more people working in our country than at any time in the history of our country, almost 160 billion. 00 in the morning, they are watching. The whole world was watching. That was the most exciting television that anybody's ever seen. Even ESPN, some guy on ESPN said, \\\"This is the most exciting event I've ever seen.\\\" And all he does is watch sporting events and big ones. But since the election, 7 million brand new beautiful jobs have been added and we've invested more than $2 trillion into that military that we talked about. And we created- Into that military that we talked about, and we created something that's very exciting. And we have our great new General. He's on the \\u2026 he's on our \\u2026 I'll tell you, he was on a list of the most incredible men you've ever seen. The sixth branch of the United States Armed forces, the Space Force. And I will be making a big decision for the Space Force as to where it's going to be located, and I know you want it. We'll be making that decision toward the end of the year. I was here, I did your \\u2026 I met \\u2026 I was up at the Air Force Academy, and I greeted those kids, they were so great. I did the commencement address. Was anybody there? I did the commencement address. And the General said, sir, would you like to shake hands with the cadets? I said, does everyone else do it, President? Oh, yes, sir. What he didn't say is, they'll shake 10 hands. I said, so they do \\u2026 how many do you have? Sir, we have 1156 cadets. I said, you mean other people do it? Yes, sir. But they don't do 1156. They'll do 30, 40. They'll take the top 10 out of the class. I said, I'll do it. I stood there for two and a half hours and the sun was blazing. True. And I shook 1156 hands. And a lot of these kids are very strong physically. In fact, you have one of them as an example, he was the winner of the home run derby. Did you know that? College \\u2026 think of that. The college home run derby. I said, let me see you. I want to see what you look like. He stands up, uniform, everything else. And by the way, I did something for Air Force, but I did something for all of the academies. If you were a great athlete and they had a hard time recruiting, although they've done well, if you're a great athlete, you can't \\u2026 we wanted to get them to go, but they didn't because they didn't want to serve five years in the military and then they'd go into the NFL or baseball. So, I had one of the teams in. They said, sir, give us the waiver, sir. They've been after the waiver. You know what the waiver is? That means that if you're a great athlete, you can go to the Air Force Academy, or Army, Navy, the Coast Guard, you can go to one of our service academies. I did the rule and we got it through Congress. And you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues and to the NFL, and you serve your time after, when you get out. Isn't that great? And the Army coach, who's a great guy \\u2026 all great guys. Navy coach, Army coach, said sir, if you do that, we can compete with anybody, because we lost lot of great athletes who said, you know, we just can't do that. Now they serve their time afterwards. Isn't that great? And we did it. They've been trying to get that for so many years. But I love that group of people. I saw this guy from the home run derby, and I shook hands. Oh, I shook hands. And they come up and they're strong people. And they're shaking, and they're excited. They're a little nervous, maybe. They're meeting the President. They're a little nervous, and they're strong. They've got big, strong hands, and they're saying \\u2026 and I'm saying, hello. Sir, thank you. Man. Jeez. What are you? I'm captain of my wrestling team, sir. I admire you greatly, sir, thank you, sir. It's like \\u2026 and I'm trying to act like it doesn't hurt. By the end of the day, I'm going like \\u2026 but we did it. And then I said, wait a minute. I said, General, no other President could do that. The Presidents don't do that. He said, no, they do, sir, but they stop, usually, at around 50. Oh, that's great. But I love the Air Force Academy. And you have all of the infrastructure, so you're being very strongly considered for the Space Command. Very strongly. And actually, I have to say this. I think I can say this, Mr. Senator, but the Governor showed up at the plane today, your Governor. Democrat. No, but in all fairness, he showed up because he wanted to lobby to see if they could get it. That's okay, that's all right. And we are going to be making that decision, Cory, when we make that decision, all right? Okay. But we've destroyed the ISIS territorial caliphate 100 percent. We killed the founded and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. He's dead. He's dead. And we just killed the world's number one terrorist, Qasen Soleimani, ending his evil reign of terror forever. Forever and ever. He was the king of the roadside bomb, right? When you see these young men and in some cases women, no legs, no arms. They get it, and 92 percent of them were from Soleimani, and then they started making them \\u2026 they had great detection. We had these guys, great detection, then all of a sudden, the detection wasn't working because they started making them out of plastic instead of metal. So they're blowing the guys up with the scopes, so they had the scopes on and that happened recently because they started making it out of plastic. Real scum, but he's gone, he's evil, he's dead, and America is respected again like never before. But as we keep on winning, Washington Democrats keep on losing their minds. They've gone nuts. That's why millions of registered Democrats, voters, people that were with the Democrats for a long time, they're leaving their party to join our movement. They're joining our great Republican party. We have more enthusiasm than any party has had in the last 50 years. And don't believe stories, and don't believe polls, because the polls are worse than the stories. They give phony polls. 00. The polls have closed \\u2026 and you know they only announce if you're very \\u2026 if you're really going to win by a lot. Otherwise, it takes all night. The polls have closed in the great state of Texas. Donald Trump has won the great state of Texas. Thank you. But they had Alfred E. Newman, Buttigieg, little Buttigieg. I said, I've had you up to here. They had little Buttigieg leading Donald Trump in Texas. These people. But very close. They said, it's too close to call, where Buttigieg \\u2026 so, a friend of mine from Texas, a big, powerful, strong guy, real Texas, he's got the cowboy hat \\u2026 I'd love to wear that hat, I wouldn't have to comb my hair so much. I wouldn't need hairspray, right? I love those Texas hats. I don't know if we'd get away with it in Washington, that's my only problem, but I love them. This guy wears that big hat, the biggest hat. He's a big guy. And he's interviewed by somebody. He said, listen, I don't know much about politics, but I can tell you one thing. Buttigieg is not tied with the President. The President is leading him by 20 points. It's like I said the last time, nobody's leading Trump in Texas. And you know what? Nobody is even close to us in the great state of Colorado. We're leading big. Nobody. With your energy and enthusiasm, this November, and specifically it's November 3rd is the big day, and this is going to be as big \\u2026 and I can't say bigger, because what was bigger than that? They came from the hills, they came from the mountains, they came out of the rivers, they came all over the place. Great people, they just never saw anybody they wanted to vote for. Women would come in, they hadn't voted in 20 years, great women, beautiful women, strong women, smart women, wives. No, no, incredible. And they love our country and they work hard and they pay their taxes and they work and they're \\u2026 we're the elite, just so you \\u2026 they're not the elite, we're the elite. And you know what? They'd show up, they've got Trump bandanas along with our great Vice President Mike Pence, Trump Pence, and they got the hats now and they walk \\u2026 these are people that were never political people. They never wore a pin. Now they've got 30 pins all over their chest, they've got the hats with the things and the Trump, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. Really, it's a great revolution, and we're turning this country around. And I'm not saying anything can ever compete with 2016, but I think if we don't do it, a lot of what we've done, and we're going to go over the jobs and the regulation cuts and what we've done for the vets with choice and accountability, but you know what? They can undo it, but in four years they can't undo it, because that tree will be planted. It will be solid. They're not going to be able to do it, so we've got to win. And your second amendment is at stake, remember that. So this November, we're going to take back the House, we're going to hold the Senate, and we are going to keep the White House. So we're thrilled tonight to be joined by many great leaders from across this incredible state and from all over the country, and I want to thank Mike Pence. I heard he gave a great speech. I never want it to be too good. I never want it to be too good. I said, Mike, take it easy. Can't be too got. Mike is great. But we have Secretary David Bernhardt, Department of Interior. Thank you. Come on up, Dave. He's great. What he's doing, by the way, he's the largest landlord by a factor of about 2000. Department of the Interior. You're taking good care of Colorado, please? Okay. He's a big deal in Colorado, right? He's a big deal. All those beautiful mountains and rivers and lakes, he's the guy. You better keep them nice and clean. Believe me, we like the environment more than anybody. We want clean water and we want clean air. And you have warriors. You have guys, they fought for us. 197 to nothing. We were \\u2026 when you think of it, the Republicans, 197 on the house to nothing. Congressman Ken Buck, come on up. Congressman Scott Tipton. And Congressman Doug Lamborn. Thank you, Doug. Thank you. And we're also joined tonight by somebody that you really love, and I love him, too, but there's a reason. He's my son. Don junior. And Kimberly Guilfoyle. Kimberly, thank you, Kimberly. And a man \\u2026 he happens to own the Chicago Cubs, but that's okay. He's done an incredible job, actually. He had a five year plan on the fifth year, the stadium was fully rebuilt, and they won the World Series. That's not bad. He had a five year plan. RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts. Come on up, Todd. Come on up. Come on up, Todd. And I mentioned him a little earlier, but you didn't know he was here. I just said he's a champion, he's a winner. He's been a friend of mine for a long time. He's a tough cookie. He's the kind of people that made our country great. Truly, they've made our country great. He started off with two people fighting each other, then he got four people fighting each other, then he got them fighting each other, each other. Then he got six and eight and 12. All of a sudden people started watching and looking, and I was proud to hold his first event. That's why he loves me. They didn't want \\u2026 they said, it's too dangerous. Nobody would take it. I'm the only who said, take it. We'll take it. And it was unbelievable. I went and I said, this is great. Let's do it again. And he has been my friend for a long time. And they put together a phenomenal deal, it's called UFC. He's the UFC president. And they just sold the company. He started it off for about $ 30, and they just sold it for $4 billion. And the people that bought it said, we're not buying it unless Dana White stays back and runs it. So Dana White, come on up. He's now a very wealthy guy. Come here. You want to hear from him? Yes. What's up, Colorado? How are you today? So, I'm not a very political person, I'll start there, but let me say this. There's things that I can tell you about the President of the United States that you don't hear on t.v. and you don't hear from other people. Like you said, I've known this man for 20 years. We've actually become even closer since he's become the President of the United States. When somebody becomes the President of the United States, you don't ever expect to hear from them again, and I understand it. It absolutely makes sense. This guy is so loyal and such a good friend, every time I see him \\u2026 I saw him today. When I met him on Air Force One, the first thing he said to me is, how is your family? How is your family? Good man, very loyal, and a very good friend. I see a lot of things from Mr. Trump that the public doesn't see, and the people who surround me every day see how this man treats me as a friend, and other people he's friends with. He's a fighter, he loves this country, he's doing great things for this country, and we got to win this election again, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you. That was beautiful, because we get tired of hearing from these politicians all the time. Right, politicians? What a job he does, and we thank you very much, Dana, and you are my great friend, and thank you. But with Cory and with me, they're not going to play with your second amendment. Not going to happen, but it's \\u2026 it is under siege. You see what's happening. But somebody \\u2026 we fight together, and he's been so great. Cory Gardner, please come on up, please. Thank you. That's beautiful. That's true of the pipeline. A long time they've been trying. We got it right away, and we'll be announcing something very big toward the end of the year. Cory is a champion for the people of Colorado. He loves your state. Look, he loves your state. He was here, he does the tractor thing. He loves tractors, he sells a certain type. And don't worry, if there's any noise, just let them \\u2026 they won't hear us. And he's got my complete and total support and endorsement. He will never let you down. The unemployment rate among African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Asian-Americans has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. And for women, 71 years, and soon you're going to be hitting the historic number. 71 years, the best numbers in 71 years. African-American and Hispanic-American poverty has plummeted to the lowest rates ever recorded. The unemployment rate for women is going \\u2026 and I'm telling you, within a very short period of time, you're going to see some statistics coming out on \\u2026 statistics. I've got to do it right, otherwise they'll say, what's wrong? If you go 16 of these, and if you mispronounce one word, they say, what's wrong? Statistics for women that are going to be unbelievable. They're going to be unbelievable. The best ever. The veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low. Workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment ever recorded in U.S. history. Half a million more Hispanic-Americans now own a home. We've lifted 10 million people off of welfare, and median household income is now at the highest level in the history of our country. Think of that. Think of this. To lift up forgotten communities that need investment the most we created with Tim Scott great guy, great Senator from South Carolina, opportunity zones. Jobs and investment are now pouring in to over 125 newly-designated opportunity zones right here in Colorado. You know about that, right? It's been amazing. Opportunity zones are amazing, what's happened. We're supporting working families by fighting for paid family leave and getting it, reducing the cost of child care, and giving 40 million American families an average of $2,200 in their pockets directly thanks to the Republican child tax credit. People don't know that. Our historic regulatory reduction campaign is ending the tyranny of Washington bureaucrats. We repealed the ridiculous waters of the United States rule, which was basically taking away your property. And we are taking the Bureau of Land Management out of Washington, DC. We're just on it, and thank you very much Secretary Bernhardt. Just up here, nice, slim, beautiful looking man. He looks beautiful. When you work with him he's beautiful because he gets it done, and you're moving it and it's headquarters to Grand Junction, Colorado because we believe that the people who manage the lands of the great American west should live right here in the great American west. And we have ended the war on American energy. It was a war, and we're up here and we're doing it. We are right now energy independent, can you believe it? They want to use wind, wind, wind. Blow wind, please. Please blow. Please keep the birds away from those windmills, please. Tell those beautiful bald eagles, oh, a bald eagle. You know, if you shoot a bald eagle, they put you in jail for a long time, but the windmills knock them out like crazy. It's true. And I think they have a rule, after a certain number are killed you have to close down the windmill until the following year. Do you believe this? Do you believe this? And they're all made in China and in Germany. Siemans. And for those of you that want to hear it, when they're making them, more stuff goes up into the air and up into the ozone, the atmosphere. More stuff is going up there, they're making it, ay, ay, ay. And they don't say this, but after a period of time they get tired, they get old, they get rusty, and a lot of the guys say, hey, their useful life is gone. Let's get the hell out of here, and they're all over the place. You look at Palm Springs, California. Take a look. Palm Springs, they're all over the place. They're closed, they're rotting, they look like hell. Every major Democrat running for President wants to entirely eliminate American production of oil and natural gas, crushing Colorado's economy, destroying tens of thousands of Colorado energy jobs and demolishing property values all across the state. They're doing that. Look, you're going to vote for one of these people, probably crazy Bernie. He seems to be leading. Mini Mike, I thought he might come up, but he can't because he can't debate. He wasn't meant for the camera, do we agree? He wasn't exactly great last night. No, I think he lost too last night. Only in Colorado could somebody say that. No, you're going to probably \\u2026 it looks like Bernie, doesn't it? It looks like crazy Bernie. Crazy Bernie's not big into natural gas and oil, and the things that keep our great factories and plants going. But Colorado voters will never let it happen. We're reversing decades of calamitous trade policies. America lost one in four manufacturing jobs following the twin disasters of NAFTA and China's entrance into the WTO. But under this administration, all of that is changing. The era of economic surrender is over, thank you. It's over. Last month, we ended the NAFTA catastrophe and I signed the brand new U.S-Mexico-Canada agreement into law. Incredible deal. The USMCA is a gigantic victory for farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers all across the great state of Colorado and every other state. Also, something we got that people don't talk about, if you love your children, you don't have to pay estate taxes on your beautiful small farms and businesses. If you love your children, it's great, and if you don't love your children, don't worry about it. Who in the hell knows. If you don't love them, don't leave that beautiful farm to your children. Give it to somebody else, okay? If they don't treat you well, give don't leave them a damn thing. Are you listening, Donnie? Are you listening, Donnie? I also took \\u2026 no, it is true. That's a big deal. Farmers were leaving their ranch and their farms and their \\u2026 people were leaving their small businesses to their family and they were being assessed in valued much higher in many cases than it was worth. You couldn't do it. They'd go out \\u2026 your kids would go out and borrow a lot of money. They'd end up losing their business, losing your farm that was in your family for 150 years. You know what happens. And they're good kids, and maybe they'll never be you. They can't farm like you and maybe they can't any maybe they can, maybe they're better. But you know what? They'd go out and they'd borrow a lot of money and they'd lose the farm. The numbers are staggering. We got rid of it. No more death tax, no more inheritance tax. And I also took the strongest ever action to confront China's massive theft of American jobs. What they've done to us over the years, we were losing 200 billion, 300, 400, 500, not million, billion. Billion. Not million. 500 million would be a lot. We're talking about 500 billion, they were taking it. Our strategy worked. We put tariffs up, 25 percent on the first 250 billion. Billions of dollars poured into the United States. They devalued their currency and they pumped money in. We didn't pay for it despite the fact that these guys \\u2026 they like to say they did, we didn't pay for it, and I'll tell you what. China- They like to say they did. We didn't pay for it. I'll tell you what, China came to the table, and we made a deal that's great for us and hopefully it's great for them. Last month, as you know, we signed a groundbreaking trade agreement with China that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, and boost American exports $250 billion worth of purchases, $50 billion worth of farm agricultural purchase, $50 billion. You know the most they ever purchased were $16 billion. You know that story. I've told it a couple of times. $16 billion was the most ever. Secretary Sonny Purdue agriculture, he's done a great job. I said, \\\"Who's the most? What's the biggest year?\\\" \\\"$16 billion, sir.\\\" I said, \\\"All right, make it 20.\\\" So they agreed on 20 so now we're getting ready to close the deal, biggest trade deal ever made, biggest deal ever made. We're getting ready to close the deal between that and USMCA. We're getting ready to close it. I go over, I say, \\\"What do you have down for the farmers? They've been great,\\\" although I have been helping you out. I gave you a lot of money. I gave you a lot of money. $16 billion on year, $12 billion from the year before. I took it out of the tariffs or we had a lot leftover, but think of it. But I said, \\\"So tell me fellas, let me ask you, what do we have? What's the number?\\\" \\\" 20 billion, sir.\\\" They're going to purchase 20 billion worth of farm products. I said, \\\"Make it 50. Tell them to make it 50.\\\" So, we went to China and they were great. You know they got 1.5 billion people. You got a lot of feeding to do. I said, \\\"Do me a favor, instead of 20 billion purchased from our farmers, would you make it 50?\\\" \\\"No, no, no, no, no,\\\" and they agreed to do it. They agreed to it. I don't think you're going to be able to make it. You better be able to make it. I don't want the farmers coming to me, sir, sir, I'm sorry we can't produce that much, sir. I said, \\\"Our farmers will find a way. They'll go out and buy larger tractors and they'll buy some extra land.\\\" Go out and buy a bigger tractor or something. No, but it is true. I've had people say, \\\"Sir, they can't produce that much.\\\" I said, \\\"Forget it.\\\" They will. Look at them. You're a farmer. They'll figure that one out. Although Mike Bloomberg said you'll never figure it out. They'll figure it out long before him. You'll figure that one out long before him. No, I know the farmers. I'm not worried about it. $50 billion on no issue have Washington Democrats more thoroughly sold out the American people than on immigration. Every day Democrats open border policies are harming and killing innocent lives. This region alone, last year ICE officers arrested over 2000, and by the way, our ICE officers, these guys are tough and they're brave. Over 2000 criminal aliens, that's MS-13 gangs, thousands, and they bring them back to where they came from. By the way, now their countries take them back. They weren't taking them back, safe third agreements. They take them back. Charged or convicted of dangerous offenses including robbery, rape, and murder. We bring them back and in some cases we don't even want to bring them back. We have to put them. I don't want to house them for the next 50 years, but you know what? We don't want to take chances either, but we'll bring them back to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico. We bring them back. They didn't use to take them. They said, \\\"We don't want them back. Oh, okay, we'll keep them ourselves.\\\" We don't do that anymore. In Denver, an illegal alien was recently charged with brutally stabbing a judge multiple times, attempting to murder him his own home. The alien had been arrested 36 times over the past 20 years. Other than that, he was a very fine fellow, for crimes including assault and child abuse, yet somehow they kept letting him go and he was still in our country. In communities across the nation, radical, and we're watching them very closely, left wing politicians are imposing deadly sanctuary cities, and sanctuary states, and policies that compel local law enforcement to release these illegal aliens straight into your beautiful communities. Last year, Colorado Democrats enacted a law declaring this entire state to be a sanctuary for dangerous criminals. As a result of state and local sanctuary policies, officials in Boulder defied federal law enforcement and released a previously deported child molester into the community. In Denver, officials released a criminal alien arrested on felony drug charges, and now he is a very dangerous man. We just caught him for attempted murder. Right here in Colorado Springs, El Paso County officials defied the requests of federal law enforcement and released a criminal alien arrested for robbery, assault, and kidnapping. They released him straight into your community. These are the Democrats. These are your Democrats. Democrats think that Colorado should be a haven for murderers, predators, kidnappers, and felons in our country and that come in illegally. Republicans believe that Colorado should be a sanctuary for law abiding Americans, not criminal aliens. If you want to shut down sanctuary cities and stop sanctuary states, if you want to protect your family and your loved ones, you must vote for Cory, vote for Trump, vote for the Republican party. We're getting it done. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure the border, we've reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. Illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and we have ended the horrible practice of catch and release. You know what you do? You catch him. You say, \\\"Where do you live?\\\" They don't live here. They don't have an address. \\\"Where do you live? Give us your address.\\\" They don't have an address. Many are criminals. Many are very dangerous criminals. So they're saying, and we are building the wall. It's gone up 122 miles as of yesterday. It's a serious wall. Did you hear? Two weeks ago, a small section, twice the size of this stage, we were putting it up and they're pouring the concrete, and a lot of, it's Mexico, it's very rough territory, some of it. It's partially desert. We were in a rough area, very windy, and we had a tremendous sand and wind storm. So we hadn't put it in. We put it in and it was just getting set, and we got hit with a tornado of wind and it blew it down, and the fake news said Trump's wall fell down. It was blown down. But see, at least we have a voice where we can explain. It's true. We lifted it up and we held it up. When the storm went by, we had it set and it's set beautifully, and the following day, that sucker is going to be up for many, many years. Can you imagine? I said what happened in a certain area, and we're doing a great job by the way, in New Mexico. New Mexico is going to be a great, great state for the Republican party, and Arizona, what we're doing on the border in Arizona, they want us to do it badly. But can you imagine that? A thing falls over because the concrete was just poured, it's soaking wet and it falls over, and they make it sound like the wall fell down. These are very, very dishonest people, but you know that. Border patrol has seized the largest amount of deadly narcotics over the last year ever recorded. It's horrible what's happening, the largest amount ever recorded. We've deported record numbers of gang members, especially the MS-13 gang members, but there are others that are just as bad. We've done more to secure the border than any administration in the history of our country. The border is going to be very soon secured. We'll have, some time next year, over 500 miles of beautiful, powerful wall built. Washington Democrats have never been more extreme taking cues from crazy Bernie Sanders, 132 congressional Democrats have signed up for Bernie's healthcare takeover that would strip 180 million Americans of their great private coverage that you want. While the Socialist Democrats are trying to destroy American healthcare, and trying to destroy your social security, that won't happen with me, my administration is protecting your social security, your Medicare, and is fighting to give you great, great healthcare, already done a good job. We're defending your right to keep the doctor, and to keep the plan of your choice. Remember, President Obama 28 times, he said, \\\"Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan. Keep your doctor. Keep your plan.\\\" Right? It was a lie. We should impeach him. We should impeach him. Impeach Obama. Get him out of office. No, nobody thought of that. We caught him in a lie 28 times at least. He's on record. We caught him in a lie, but nobody said let's impeach him. Only these maniacs, crazy Nancy Pelosi, crying Chuck Schumer. What about the little pencil neck, right? Pencil neck. He's got the world's smallest neck. Here's a guy that lied about my statement. He made up a statement and he delivered it before a contract. He made up a statement. It was totally fiction. He made it up and then they tell me, you're getting ready to sue him, and they say, \\\"Oh no, he's protected because he made the statement in the halls of Congress.\\\" That should be worse. No, that should worse. Little wise guy. We're making healthcare better and much cheaper while premiums more than doubled in the five years before I took office. We're now offering plans that are up to 60% less expensive and they're better. They're better. We're protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. We're fighting to stop surprise medical billing. I signed an executive order imposing price transparency. That's going to be bigger than healthcare in a certain way. Watch the prices come down because when providers are required to show their prices, those same prices fall very, very fast. We have approved a record number of affordable new generic drugs, which are just as good as the name brand drugs, but at a tiny fraction of the cost. We have totally transform veteran's health care, including getting the long sought VA choice and VA accountability. So, now if our veterans have to wait in line, they go out to a doctor, a local doctor, we pay the bill and they're all set. They don't have to wait for six weeks. He's agreeing, right? Good. Right? You don't see those stories. You used to see all these horrible vet stores, veterans, the veterans on television, and you don't see it because veterans choice, it's amazing. Our great veterans, here's a man right here. You're saying, yes. Purple Heart. Thank you. Thank you. That's great. But it's a lot different under Trump, isn't it? A lot different under Trump, and now you go out to a private doctor, but you know, we also got accountability. They've been trying to get these things done for 45, 46, 48 years, couldn't get them done. I'm good at getting things approved. I have to say. But, we also got accountability where we can fire people that aren't taking care of our vets. If somebody isn't doing a good job, you couldn't fire him. Now you look at him, you say, \\\"Get the hell out of here. You're fired.\\\" We passed another thing. For 44 years, they've been trying to get it passed, the spectacular Right to Try, where we can use our medicines that are in trial if somebody is terminally ill or very sick, we can use it and we are having tremendous results, Right to Try. I hope that nobody in this room needs it. I hope you don't need it, but if you do, we have the best in the world, and we're seeing amazing results. We're combating the opioid epidemic. Drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. We are pursuing new advances in neonatal research to care for America's youngest patients and breaking all records in so doing. All of the radical Democrats in the Presidential debates have declared their unlimited support for extreme late term abortion, ripping babies straight from the mother's womb, right up until the very moment of birth. You know that. That is why at my State of the Union, I asked Congress to prohibit late term abortion for babies, because republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. The Democrat party is the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, blatant corruption, and the total obliteration of your second amendment. That's what it is. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and the late great Abraham Lincoln. People forget that. People forget Honest Abe. He's the most presidential guy. I've always said I could be more presidential than anybody, but I'm not sure I can beat Honest Abe when he wears the hat. That hat is too much. It's so easy to be presidential, so easy. It's so much easier than doing what I have to do, but you know what I'd have? I'd have about three people in the front row. How about sleepy Joe? How about his performance? What? What? It's great to be with the great people of Ohio. Joe, Joe, you're in Iowa. You're an Iowa. Oh, wow. He did it five times. So far, I've never done it. Thank you. I've never done it. If I do it, that's a bad sign. Now he does it all the time. He was in New Hampshire and he said he was in Vermont. It's great to be in Vermont. Joe, you're in New Hampshire. Dammit. He'd go up and tell him again and again. Joe, what the hell is wrong with you, Joe? Sleepy Joe. He's sleepy Joe. He was sleepy a long time ago, but now he's really sleeping. But it's easy to be presidential. You know that. The easiest thing you could do is presidential. Never open your jacket. Never. It's got to be buttoned up. Right? Ladies and gentleman, the President of the United States. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's so great to be with the people of Colorado. Thank you, everybody. Good night. Good night. No, no. It's so easy. It's so easy, honestly. Look, I did very well with the State of the Union, right? They said it was one of the best. Smart, smart. Smart guy. We do good. We're representing you. I better do good. If I didn't do good, you'd dump me so fast. Actually, I don't think you would dump be so fast, actually. You want to know the thing? She said, \\\"we're never dumping you.\\\" Fake news CNN went up to a woman. \\\"What does it take for you to leave the President?\\\" \\\"I'm not leaving him.\\\" There were 10 women, and the one woman, beautiful, incredible women, and they had their bandanas, they had hats, Trump, and stupid CNN, they go up, \\\"What does it take for you?\\\" Then he goes, \\\"Look, he said one time that his people are so good, they'd stay with him if he shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue.\\\" Do you remember? Right? \\\" Would you stay if he shot somebody?\\\" This is actually an answer, or something to the effect, \\\"Would you say every shot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue?\\\" The woman looks, \\\"Well, it depends why he shot him.\\\" Makes sense. Depends why he shot him. But then they said, \\\"We're not leaving him. We're never leaving him.\\\" We're in thing together, folks. We got the swamp. We got that dirty, rotten swamp. We got crooked politicians. We got a lot of bad people, but we're getting them out one by one. We better be, little Adam Schiff, that little Adam Schiff. What a crooked politician. He's a corrupt politician. Talking about guys, he'll lie and then the next day get caught. He'll be sorry that he got caught. The next day he'll walk up to the mic and say exactly the same thing. He's got no shame. He's got no shame. He's a liar. I think he's a sick person. Republicans are fighting for the citizens from every background, every community, and every walk of life. You know that we're the party of boundless optimism, excitement, energy and enthusiasm. We are asking all Americans to join our incredible movement. We are the big tent. We are the big party. We have the big ideas for the future. Republicans are fighting for school choice, big deal, it's a big deal, because no parents should ever be forced to send their child to a failing government school. To uphold the new rule of law, we have confirmed 217 brand new, beautiful federal judges who will interpret the Constitution as written. That's a record. That is a record that it includes 192 judges who are appointed for a lifetime. So, think of it. If they're 40 years old, if they're 45 years old, they can be there for 40, 50 years. As you know, and by the way, that's a record by a lot. I have the record, but there's one record that probably nobody will get the percentage record. Who has the percentage? Do you know? George Washington, 100%. But it was only 16 people. So, with 217, can you imagine that? It's a record and we're going up. We're going up. The Democrats are thrilled about that one, and as you know, I have nominated and we have confirmed two great new Supreme court justices, Colorado zone, right? Colorado. That's right. Colorado zone, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. Neil Gorsuch, that's right. Colorado. He's a great guy, too, great guy. Colorado. That's a big thing. That's another great check you have down for count. Neil Gorsuch. I recognized Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. They said they were going to do it for years. We recognize Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. Our investments in the United States military include more than $300 million this year. Has anyone ever heard of a place called Fort Carson? Another place, Peterson Air Force Base, you know that. Another place, the Air Force Academy, you know that, and Schriever, right, Air Force Base Schriever. Schriever. Was that right? Schriever, right? Schriever, that's a little tricky one. It took me a little while. I'm looking at that sucker. I'm saying, \\\"Schriever, right.\\\" Thank you. That's very nice. He saw he was having a little trouble with that one. That's tricky. You don't like to mispronounce a word. You come to a great place like this and instead of calling it Fort Carson, you go at Fort crasson, and they say, \\\"Oh, this guy doesn't know anything about us.\\\" No, a lot of money going into Fort Carson. It's great. For years, you watched as your politicians apologize for America. You saw that. Well, I'd like to apologize. We don't apologize. Now you have a President who is standing up for America and we are standing up for the great people of Colorado. At stake in our present battle is the survival of our nation. If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for, they wanted to secure these great rights that we all have, then we must devote everything we have toward victory in November of 2020, November 3rd. Only this way can we save the America we love and drain the Washington swamp once and for all. We'll get it finished. We'll get it finished. They're bad people. They're all over the place. They're bad people. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence, and poverty to prosperity. You know that. Together we will elect a Republican Congress to create a fair, safe, sane and lawful system of immigration. We will continue to enact great new trade deals like we've been doing. I'm going to India next week and we're talking trade. They've been hitting us very hard for many, many years, but I really like Prime Minister Modi. We got to talk a little. We've got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs. One of the highest in the world is India. But I hear they're going to have 10 million people, they say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world, the largest cricket stadium in the world, which is brand new and beautiful. But you know what, and the only problem with doing that, Prime Minister Modi said, \\\"We will have 10 million people greet you.\\\" Here's my problem. We have a packed house. We have a lot of people, thousands of people that couldn't get in. It's going to look like peanuts from now on. I'll never be satisfied with the crowd. If we have 10 million people in India, how can I be satisfied if we fill up a 60,000 seat stadium? Big deal. See, I'm getting spoiled. He said, \\\"Build a bigger stadium.\\\" That's good. Colorado, very good. But it's going to result in more products proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA. That beautiful phrase. We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer. They've made such progress, and ending the AIDS epidemic in America. We started a year ago. It should have been started long before in the last administration because they had the technology then. They didn't start it, but we're starting it. We'll have it done within nine years. It's a 10 year process. Think of that. AIDS. we will land the first woman on the moon and become the first station in the world to plant our flag on Mars. You have a lot of that action happening right here. We will defend privacy, free speech, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. That's a big one. Above all, we will never stop fighting for the sacred values that bind us together as one, beautiful America. We support, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and to always respect our great American flag. We live by the words of our national motto, In God We Trust, from Pueblo to Fort Collins, from Denver to Durango, from Black Forest to Broomfield, from Castle Rock to right here in Colorado Springs, we stand on the shoulders of red blooded American Patriots who poured out their heart, and sweat, and soul, to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. Colorado was founded by pioneers and prospectors, cowboys and miners, and ranchers who tamed the wilderness, explored the west, scaled the Rockies, fought the battles, and helped make this the greatest nation ever to exist on the face of the Earth, and we are making it greater every single day greater than ever before. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement, one people, one family and one glorious nation under God. America's thriving like never before, and ladies and gentlemen of Colorado, the best is yet to come. Together we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you people of Colorado.\",\n          \"Thank you very much and thank you to the original Lee Greenwood. Thank you. Thank you, Lee. Great guy. Well, I just want to say a very big hello, Kentucky? Great place. It's great to be here in the home of a group called the Wildcats. You ever hear the Kentucky Wildcats? By the way, they play at a very big arena. This place. Look at this. Hello, up there? This is incredible. With thousands of proud, hardworking, freedom-loving American patriots, which is what you are. What you are. Tomorrow, the people of Kentucky will head to the polls and you will vote to reelect your terrific Republican governor, Matt Bevin. He's done a fantastic job. He's done a fantastic job. And we're sending a signal by doing that to the rest of the country, to the rest of the world, that the republican party, you know what we stand for. But you see what's happening with the Democrats, they have gone crazy. The do nothing Democrats, and they're not getting it done. Under Republican leadership, the economy is booming, wages are rising, confidence is soaring. Kentucky is thriving like never ever before, and America is stronger than ever before. True. Kentucky's unemployment rate has reached the lowest point in the history of our country. That's not bad. And I want to just tell you that you have incredible representatives, and the job that Matt Bevin has done as governor, he's had to do some things that you had to do. And he's done unbelievably well. It sets you up to be a rocket ship in the future. You had to do it. So I just want to thank him for having the courage to do what he had to do. You have the best numbers you've ever had in the history of the state. And with the help of your Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, we have confirmed 157 judges to follow the constitution as written. We're supporting our police, we're rebuilding our military, we're defeating radical Islamic terrorists like never before. The monsters animal known as Al-Baghdadi is dead. And the man that took his place is dead also. American Special Forces gave the world's number one terrorist a one way ticket to hell. No enemy on earth stands a chance against the awesome power of the United States military, which is now stronger than ever before. We've rebuilt it and it was all made in America. All made in America. And our country is winning again, and our country is highly respected again. But while we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the radical democrats are going totally insane. They want to obliterate the rule of law, drive out faith from the public square, and you know this, silence you online, confiscate your guns. You better be careful. The Second Amendment very, very important, very precious. They are after your Second Amendment. With us, nobody's touching our Second Amendment. And that includes the gentleman that's running against Matt. They're after your Second Amendment. We can't let that happen. They want to indoctrinate your children, you know this, destroy anyone who calls traditional America American values. All you have to do is ask the boys from Covington Catholic High School. Some of whom are here tonight. The far left wants to impose their authoritarian ideology on the nation, telling you what to think, what to believe and how you should live. They want to erase our traditions, our culture, our history, and our heroes. They want to subjugate you and break you to their will, but Kentucky will never be broken. Kentucky can't be broken. You're too strong and you're too smart. In their craze thirst for power, the democrats are trying to tear our country apart. First, Democrats engineer the Russia hoax, the most egregious fraud ever foisted upon the American people, the Russian hoax. Then they did the Mueller scam. You remember that? The Mueller scam. Two years and they said nothing. And then Mr. Mueller testified. That was a wonderful day for me. You remember last week. I don't know Tulsi Gabbard, but Hillary Clinton said that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian agent. I don't know Jill Stein. She's a Greenie and that's fine. She's a Greenie, Jill Stein. But Jill Stein was an agent of Russia also. These people are crazy. Now corrupt politicians, Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff, they are corrupt. And Nancy, unlike Kentucky, which is doing great, Nancy ought stop wasting time, go back to her district in San Francisco, help the homeless, get rid of the drugs, get rid of the needles that are lying all over the street, and all of the things that are washing into the ocean through their storm sewer system. What's happened is San Francisco and what's happened to so many other places run by the radical left Democrats, it's unbelievable. Los Angeles. You take a look at Los Angeles, looks like a third world city. But go back to Nancy's area, look at what's happened. There's been no place in the country that's gone down like the area that Nancy Pelosi represents. And she's wasting all of her time. And you know what, it's backfiring. You see it. But the media and the democrats have launched an even more brazen assault on our nation, with a deranged hyperpartisan impeachment witch-hunt. Impeachment. Think of it. So today, we just hit the highest number in the history of the stock market. Now, that's hundreds of days. So last week, think of this, in the history of our country, it's never done better. And by the way, that's not rich, that's not poor, that's for everybody. Your 401s, how you are doing? Pretty good, right? Pretty good. People tell me that their wives, their husbands, all of a sudden, they've been running the 401s for years. And they totally lost respect for let's say, the husband, totally lost respect. Now they think he's a financial genius because he's up 74%. She says, darling, I love you. You are the most incredible, brilliant financial mind. And you know what, if the Democrats get in, that's not going down by 50%, that's going down to nothing. It's going to be worthless. It's going to be worthless. You'll have a depression the likes of which you've never seen. Mark my words. But hopefully, we don't have to even think about it. And that was going to happen here. When we took over, that was going down in the wrong direction. And don't forget, that was zero interest. We're paying interest. In other words, people are now getting interest in their money. But that was with zero interest, real easy with zero interest. Last week, the democrats voted to try and nullify the balance of 10s of millions of Americans. To be exact 63 million people, disgracing themselves and bringing shame upon the House of Representatives. They've been plotting to overthrow the election since the first hour that we won. And actually, before we won, they were plotting to overthrow this election. Before we won. 19 minutes after I took the oath of office, that disgusting Washington Post, look at all these people back there, look. Fake news media. It's the fake news. Look at all of them. What they don't know is that when we hang it up in 5 years or 9 years, or 13 years, or maybe 17 years, or maybe if I still have the strength, 21 years. See, now they're going crazy. Now they're saying, see, I told you, he was a dictator. He wants to take charge in control of our country. These people are crazy said. The guy goes, well, we're going to fight and we're going to \\u2026 No, no. He's going to win. You know he's never leaving office, don't you? He's never going to leave office. These people are crazy. They're crazy. But that disgusting newspaper that's right there, The Washington Post, declared the campaign to impeach President Trump has just begun. All right, you can get them out. Be gentle, be gentle. Be very gentle. You know every time I say, get them out of here, I end up getting sued. They say, he hurt my arm. All right. So be very gentle, please. I don't want to get sued. Be very gentle. Very, very gentle. He's going home to mom. Thank you. By the way, do we love our law enforcement? And in the whole world, even on a Monday Night, I like the Monday Nights because I think we're 58 and 0, that's a good record. Even for the Wildcats, that's a good. We're 58 and 0, but even on a Monday Night, is there anything cooler than being at a Trump rally? Nothing can. With last week's vote, the far left has declared war on American democracy itself. These people are lunatics. In the face of these attacks, Republicans are the most unified that I've ever seen, and I've been watching them and been a big part of them for a long time. And the democrats have never witnessed anything like it, and they know they're not going to win in 2020. So let's see what can we do to win, but that's not working too well. You'll see. The American people are fed up with Democrat lies, hoaxes, slander. The Democrats outrageous conduct has created an angry majority that will vote the do nothing democrats the hell out of office soon. Tomorrow, Kentucky has a chance to send the radical Democrats a message. You will vote to reject Democrats extremism, socialism and corruption, and you will vote to reelect Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin who's done a great job. Matt's a veteran. He's a patriot. He's done it all. He's been a very, very successful business leader. He put his whole life at stake to help this state and the job he's done is incredible. Under his leadership, Kentucky has created over 57,000 new jobs, but I helped also. We work together. Now, he is difficult. I have to say, you know, maybe because of the election, but it's okay. Look, he's such a pain, when he needs something for Kentucky like money, like aid, like, he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky. Could you call the head of Some company in Japan, please? I say, \\\"Matt, do I have to do it?\\\" Please, please. But isn't that really what you wanted in a governor? That's what you want. He's such a pain in the ass, but that's what you want. And the job he's done, one of the best in the country. Not the best. He's been incredible. Matt is strong on crime and tough on illegal immigration. Thank you. He's pro-worker, pro-life and 100% Pro-Second Amendment. By the way, you're going to lose your Second Amendment if you vote in Democrats. You think I'm kidding? I see what they're saying. I watch what they're doing. They're calling me all the time. You will lose your Second Amendment as soon \\u2026 I'm telling you. As sure as you're standing here, is anybody sitting? Nobody ever sits. You can sit if you want. No, just stand. You know what they say in the fake news? Look, you've been standing. Nobody sat? I don't know. Isn't that exciting? Nobody sat. You know what they say? No, you know what they say? They say, Trump only got one standing ovation. Because they stood at the beginning and they never sat down, but they don't say the second part. It's great. Great spirit. You know why? You love our country. And you see what's happening. We have turned this big monster ship. We have turned it around. And we need so badly. You know, it's like you plant a tree. It takes a lot. We have to get those roots to hold. We have the best unemployment numbers in the history of our country, so many things. So many things. The best employment numbers, we have the best of everything. And I think I'm going to count but I think it's like 118. I told you, we have a record stock market today. I think about 100 \\u2026 I'm going to have to check it. Because you know with the fake news, if I'm off by half a point. If it's 117 and not 118, even if I go under, they report it. They say, he didn't tell the truth. It was really 119. But like a lot, over 100, where we had the highest stock market in our history. Think of that. That's incredible. But Matt Bevin has made record investments in education spending for Kentucky students. Education is so important to him. Matt Bevin will defend your Kentucky values. He loves his state. From an all out assault being waged on you from the extreme left. Not good. I can't even imagine, how can you vote for somebody from the extreme left? This guy, Beshear, is a major lefty. You know that, right? Why are we even \\u2026 Let's just have a good time. Are you sure we need an election tomorrow, Matt? I don't know. How does Kentucky vote for a person \\u2026 I'm telling you, he will always vote for Pelosi and Schumer and shifty Schiff. How about this guy? How about Schiff. He makes up a conversation. He gets up before the United States Congress. He repeats my conversation with the head of the Ukraine, the new president, a good guy, repeats it. I said, \\\"I never said that.\\\" He made a horrible statement. It was a total lie. And then I actually wanted to release the actual conversation. And you haven't heard about the whistleblower after that, have you? Because the whistleblower said lots of things that were so good folks, you're going to find out. But these are very dishonest people, shifty Schiff. But Matt's running against these people, and we have to send them a sign because they're dangerous. The radical left named Andy Beshear, who rejects everything Kentucky stands for. That's who they want to win. Beshear has openly pledged to stop the policies of Donald Trump. What are the policies? Take care of our vets, take care of our military. We want jobs. We want companies to stop leaving us. They're not leaving anymore. You see, companies aren't leaving anymore. Have you noticed? Remember years ago before I ever thought of doing this? I mean, when I said let's do this, I said to our great now first lady. I said, \\\"Melania, let's give it a shot.\\\" And then, one by one, we were doing good. And what we've done, if you remember before we ran, companies were leaving Kentucky, they were leaving, they will go into Mexico. They were going to China, Japan. They were going all over. Any place but Kentucky. You don't read about that at all. Now they're all coming back. They're all coming back. But Beshear wants to shut down your coal, shut down your energy, raise your taxes, and take a giant wrecking ball to the greatest economy in the history of the state of Kentucky. The greatest economy you've ever had, he's going to destroy it. And it won't be long. It'll go very quickly. You know, you're all sitting there. Everybody has good jobs. You don't like it, you go find another job. It's like the choice I got from military. I got you choice too. If you don't like your job, you find another one. You tell the boss, I am getting out of here, I don't like this guy. You go get a better job for more money. Beshear doesn't represent you. He represents the Washington swamp and he's backed by the same people trying to overthrow the last election. Beshear supported crooked Hillary Clinton, and he's funded by the pro-abortion lobby and open borders fanatics. Open borders, let everyone pour right in. Let them all pour right in. Beshear wants to bring sanctuary cities to Kentucky, think of that one. Releasing violent criminals and aliens to terrorize innocent Kentucky families. He wants sanctuary cities. He hasn't learned what's happened. We had a great election a couple of weeks ago in North Carolina. We won two house seats. We were supposed to lose, probably both of them. We won them by a lot. We won them by a lot. And I think we won them because of the Second Amendment, because it's under assault from Democrats. But I think we won also because of sanctuary cities. Because of bad news came out of sanctuary cities, really bad. And I think that was the reason we won both house seats by a lot. Beshear is too liberal, too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky. Tomorrow, everybody needs to vote, Republican. We got to go Republican all the way. I want to bring up a man, and I'm serious about this. This guy works so hard. He's a great natural talent in business, which you needed. And he straightened it out. And I'll tell you what, he will be one of the truly greats in the history and maybe the greatest in the history of this state. Matt Bevin, come on up Matt. So we're also joined tonight by a very powerful man in Washington, your great Senator Mitch McConnell. Nobody works harder for Kentucky than Mitch. I will tell you, nobody works harder, and frankly, maybe more importantly, nobody works smarter. It's up here. I know a lot of people that work hard. He works smart. When the Democrat arsonists in Washington tried to destroy an innocent man named Brett Kavanaugh, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Mitch refused to cave to the left wing mob. And that's what it was, it was a mob. There has never been a man treated so badly in Washington as Judge Kavanaugh, previously Judge, now Justice. We got him in, and he's been great, and he will be great. Mitch confirmed two tremendous Supreme court justices. Mitch helped deliver the largest ever investment in our military and pass VA choice and VA accountability for our amazing veterans. Now, I know Mitch's opponent because they came here. Do you remember last year? Slightly different location, and that's okay, it was still the great state of Kentucky. Because Andy Barr had Amy McGrath, an extreme liberal against him. Andy Barr is here with us tonight, and we're going to introduce him, but he beat her. So she said to herself, \\\"Well, you know, I failed in Congress, now let's go for the Senate.\\\" She wanted to go to the House, now she wants to go. It's not going to work that way. Extreme liberal, anti-gun, lots of different things. Amy McGrath compared my election, think of this one \\u2026 It's so insulting. I shouldn't say it. Should I say it? Yeah, why not. No, it's so insulting. You know, you work so hard, you love your country so much, and they get up to say things. She compared it to 9/11, a slander upon our nation. She wants open borders. She supports the impeachment hoax witch hunt like nobody. She wants to get rid of it. She wasn't too happy with me last year. We came in, Andy, and we did a job on her, and this is going to be easy. She was caught telling donors, Democrats, that she is further left than anyone in the history of the State of Kentucky. Is that what you want? It's not what you want. So next November, the state needs to defend its values and vote for a rock-ribbed Kentucky conservative, Mitch McConnell. But we're going to get back to that later. We'll be back many times. We'll be back here many times. Mitch. Where is he? So President Obama left Mitch, and me, and Rand, and all of us, he left 142 openings for judges. You're not supposed to allow any. You don't do that. You know, they say the most important thing a president can do is federal judges, right? Including the Supreme Court, obviously. I came in and I said, \\\"How many do we have?\\\" They said, \\\"How many what, sir?\\\" I said, \\\"Judge openings.\\\" And I thought they'd say none, or one or two. He said, \\\"Sir, we have 142.\\\" I said, \\\"What?\\\" I said, \\\"Tell me again.\\\" He said, \\\"We have 142.\\\" So Mitch and I and Rand would like to thank very much President Obama, because nobody ever been so generous in their life. Also with us tonight is a great warrior and a great guy, smart, strong, loves your state, and he's really become a good friend of mine. And I'll tell you, he's a little bit different. It's okay. But whenever I've needed him, whenever I needed him, he was always there. It's true. I mean, sometimes like I'd say, \\\" I don't need you to vote, Rand.\\\" \\\"Good.\\\" And he'll vote his own way. He's got that little libertarian touch. That's okay. That's okay. But whenever we need, and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about we, we need a vote, he's so incredible and he's become a really good friend. I want to have him come up for a second. Rand Paul, your Senator, a great warrior. Wow, that was excellent. Whoa. Wow, thank you. Thank you very much, Rand. Great job. He's a warrior. He's a warrior, I've always said it. Also with us tonight are representatives from your state that are fantastic, a couple from outside your state, but we'll welcome them also, right? But these are also great fighters, great warriors. Hal Rogers. Thank you, Hal. Brett Guthrie. Thank you, Brett. Thomas Massey. Man we just spoke about won a great grace, Andy Barr. James Comer. James, great. And from an incredible state that we won 2016 that Crooked Hillary said she's going to win that state, didn't come too close at winning that state. It's a great state, and we love the people of North Carolina. Congressman Mark Meadows. Along with some of your local great politicians, and a person that's done a really spectacular job. You know, in Michigan, a woman, she just kept going, she just kept going. Reminded me, by the way, of your governor, from the standpoint she never quit. Now, Republicans hadn't won Michigan in many, many years. She called, \\\"Could you come again? Could you do it again? Could you come make another speech, please?\\\" I said, \\\"All right, this is the last one.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. How about a couple of more?\\\" And then Bill Clinton actually told Hillary Clinton, \\\"You better get going, something's going on in Michigan. You're going to lose Michigan. You better start going.\\\" \\\"No, no, no. The polls say everything's good.\\\" And we won the great State of Michigan for the first time in many years. And I said, when it came time to picking the Republican Party Chair, head of the RNC, I said, I got to get the woman from Michigan, Ronna McDaniel, to head it up. And when they were saying how sophisticated Hillary Clinton's campaign was \\u2026 You know, we're not sophisticated, right? I don't think so. Remember all during the \\u2026 \\\"Well, she's got the finest computer technology in the world.\\\" Yeah, she paid for it, but she didn't get it. \\\"She has really fantastic geniuses.\\\" But I had somebody that was a lot better than the people that she had. His name was Brad Parscale, and he's here with us. Campaign Manager. Doing a great job. And our numbers are looking very good. But think of it, we're one day short of a year now. Can you believe it? Less than a year. It begins November 3rd this time. We had that great, great date, oh boy, November 8th remember? Was there ever a day like that in television history? And they have no idea, because when we do hang it up, they're all out of business. They know that. That's why I think that we will get \\u2026 I expect to get a full, hearty, unbelievable endorsement very soon from the failing New York Times, and from the Amazon Washington Post. You know, before the election started, about a month before I announced that I was going to do this, I said, \\\"I'm going to become a politician. I can't believe it. I'm going to become a politician.\\\" But I looked at the New York Times, and it was like a little leaflet that you hand out at a grocery store, right? The wind would blow it away. It was dead. I call it the failing New York Times only because eventually it will fail. But we built it up. They do stories \\u2026 In my entire life, I had a few stories on the front page of the New York Times, and now if I have three or four a day, it's like, \\\"Why are they not covering me anymore?\\\" And they're all bad. They can take what we did two weeks ago with the number one terrorist in the world, and they make it look as bad as possible. In fact, I love dogs, but they gave the dog full credit. They didn't give me any credit. That's okay. The dog got the credit, and the dog will be coming very shortly, by the way, to the White House. But they'll be endorsing us. And you know, all of these crazy, like CNN with its bad ratings, there goes its red light, it just went off. Their red light just went off. See how it is? Well, it's hard. Look, put yourself in their position. They have it on, their covering, and now they know they're ready to get hit, so they turn it off. I mean, I can't blame them. Their red light just went off. No, but put yourself in CNN's position. Without us \\u2026 You know, cable was not supposed to be a good business, then we came along. It's not me, it's we. They came from the valleys, they came from everywhere, the cities, they came from places, they're still trying to figure out, \\\"Where the hell did all those people come from?\\\" It's true. A great Senator from Tennessee, they have early voting, and I was in Pennsylvania making a speech, and he saw me because he had a couple of great Congressman friends from Pennsylvania, and he said, \\\"You know, in Tennessee we have very early voting, and I just left, and I've been doing this for 24 years. And I got to be honest with you, I've never seen so many people vote.\\\" And these are people, they love our country, they're incredible, they work hard, but they never liked what they were voting for, so they really wouldn't vote. Sounds terrible. But they didn't like anything that they saw. They say, \\\"Sir, I'm seeing people,\\\" and he said this, \\\"come out from the valleys, come out from the mountains, come out from areas that they've never come out. We have lines that are five blocks long at every voting booth and parlor.\\\" He said, \\\"I can't speak for the rest of the country, but if the rest of the countries like Tennessee, you're going to have the greatest victory in the history of our nation.\\\" And that's what happened. That was a great statement. That was a great statement from people from a great state, also. Tomorrow you must elect the entire Republican ticket, from governor on down, including your next Lieutenant Governor, Ralph Alvarado. Ralph Alvarado. Great, Ralph. You're a good man. And your next Attorney General, Daniel Cameron. Should I bring Daniel up? Get up here, Daniel, come on. Here's a star. Here's a star. Mr. President, I hope you can tell that Kentucky is Trump country. We are proud to stand with you on pro-life issues, and here in the Commonwealth, we are going to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves. And Mr. President, we are going to stand with you in protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Kentuckians. And Mr. President, I make a personal commitment to you as the next Attorney General, we are going to make sure that Kentucky is never a sanctuary state. Good. That's good. Thank you, Daniel. Thank you, Daniel. Star. A star is born. A star is born. Did you ever see that movie, A Star is Born? Thank you, Daniel. Great. You're next Secretary of State, Michael Adams. Thanks, Michael. Auditor, Mark Harmon. Thank you, Mark. Treasurer, Allison Ball. She's doing great. And Agriculture Commissioner, Ryan Quarles. With the help of everyone here, America is the hottest economy anywhere in the world, by far. Foreign leaders come in to see me, \\\"Congratulations on your economy.\\\" China's doing poorly, as you know, but they're paying us billions, and billions, and billions of dollars, and they've never given us 25 cents before. Billions of dollars. They gave a lot of that money to our farmers, who got targeted, but no longer. They're back buying from our farmers. But we've created 6.7 million new jobs since the election. And if I would have ever said that during the campaign, the fake news back there would have never let me hear the end of it. Think of that, 6.7. And today, just today, a record, 158 million Americans are now employed, the highest level of employment in our country's history. African American unemployment just dropped to the lowest level ever recorded in the history of our country. Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment rates have also reached the all time historic lows. The history of our country. Hourly earnings, listen to this, are up 9% since the election. Nobody ever thought that was going to be happening. Under the previous two administrations, we lost 60,000 factories. I thought that was a typo. I said, \\\"How the hell can you lose 60,000?\\\" It turned out to be right. And you know how I know? Because I've been saying it for two years, and they never corrected me. It's true, two years. I get a call sometimes from the people in the campaign, \\\"Sir! Sir, we have an emergency.\\\" \\\"What's the emergency?\\\" \\\"Somebody's calling from the media, the fake news. Did you put a comma in the wrong location, sir? Because they consider it to be a front page story.\\\" Okay. Under my administration, we've added nearly 10,000 new factories and many, many more thousands of factories are coming into our country. We reversed it. To get relief to working families, we passed massive tax cuts, massive. To lift up distressed communities, our tax law created opportunity zones. Tim Scott of South Carolina was so involved, including 144 designated by your great governor. By the way, the other governor. I don't think \\u2026 Well, I don't know. You know? He's not going to do so well. He'll be calling for a meeting, and I won't be able to see him because I don't like him very much. But I like this one very much, and we're going to help him. We slashed a record number of job-killing regulations. We ended the war on American energy. We're now the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world. And we ended the war on beautiful clean coal. I announced the withdrawal of the United States from the horrible, costly, one-sided Paris Climate Accord. Ask them how they're doing in Paris with it. Not too good. I canceled the so called Clean Power Plan, and repealed Obama's federal coal moratorium. We're putting our great miners back to work. On trade, we're starting to set records every week, we're reversing decades of Washington disloyalty, stupidity, and corruption. Past administrations did nothing as China looted our factories, and stole up to $500 billion of American dollars. By the way, people can't even believe it. Not 500 million. That's a lot. If you lost 500 million, that's a lot. I thought that was another typo. $500 billion they would take a year from us. We rebuilt China. And I give them a lot of credit, by the way, I give China. What I don't give credit to is Obama and past administrations beyond Obama, I don't give them credit because they let it happen. They should have never let it happen. But now we're taking in tens of billions, and billions, and billions of dollars. Just recently, very slow, Slippy Joe \\u2026 Biden that is, said of China's piracy and plunder, \\\"They're not that bad, folks.\\\" He always used the word folks. I watched him today, he used the word folks. \\\"Hi folks. Hi. Hi, My time is up. I got to leave.\\\" No, they have him all freaked out because he makes a mistake every time he speaks. So I can just see these handlers, because they're handlers, like they use on horses, they're handlers, right? \\\"All right, get him off now. He's been up there long enough.\\\" So they're screaming, \\\"Get off, get off! Sleepy Joe, get off the stage, please. Please Joe, you're doing fine. Joe, you're doing fine. You're doing fine.\\\" And then he goes, \\\"I love being in Ohio,\\\" but he was in Iowa yesterday. Yes sir. And they say, \\\"Dammit, he should have left sooner, we told him. Get off the stage, Sleepy Joe. Sleepy Joe, get off the damn stage.\\\" But he said about, Sleepy Joe, about China, \\\"They're not that bad, folks. They're not really competition for us. No, they're not.\\\" 500 billion a year, right? He did nothing in eight years, him and Obama. In fact, I'm here because of them, when you think about it. Right? Just thinking. I'm here because of them. Kellyanne Conway, stand up, Kellyanne. Stand up. Another warrior. I just saw Kellyanne. I said stand up. No, but think of it, as somebody saying that. Now look, $1.5 billion that Hunter, who got thrown out of the Navy, who had no experience, who had not anything, got a lot of money from Ukraine, but he got 1.5 billion from China, I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China, they're very tough. China. I got to tell you, I've been negotiating with China. They're very tough. That is not the same group of Chinese people that I've been negotiating with. They gave him 1.5 billion. He'll make millions and millions with that. And how about saying, by the way, Mr. President, would you please take over the negotiations that President Trump is no longer handling? Guess what? You would be sold down the tubes so fast, and we're so close. China wants to make a deal so badly. I think they'd love to see another president. They would like to see another president more than crooked Hillary would, okay. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations of this deal, which is going to be one of the greatest deals ever made. Has to be, because we started down here and they were up there. Has to be. Can you imagine if they ever took over negotiations? This is what China would love more than anything else. It's not going to happen folks, because we can't let our country go back to hell. We can't do it. We can't let it happen. Because the Bidens got rich while America was robbed, and let me tell you the fake news will not put it in. I watched the last debate, and this weakling named Anderson Cooper saying, well, it's totally unsubstantiated, Mr. Biden, solely answer. What's unsubstantiated? He is on tape doing a real quid pro quo. Sure, it's totally unsubstantiated, sir. I've never seen anything like it. Could you imagine if I did what he did? Could you imagine if Don Jr. or Eric Trump walked out of China while I was, let's say, vice president or president. Let's say they walked out of China with 1.5 billion. Do you think the press would be saying, well, it's unsubstantiated? No, it's something. Let me just tell you something. These people, not all of them, but these people are very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest. But under this administration, the great betrayal is over. America is not for sale. And we're more determined than ever to drain the swamp, and that's what we're doing with these crazy people. A lot of bad things happened, and a lot of bad things I think are going to be revealed because there's no way we can allow them to get away with what they would have with a normal person gotten away with. Let's face it. These are bad people. Thanks to my tariffs, we will soon have over $100 billion from a country that didn't want to do anything with us. And I'll tell you, they started buying our farm product. You see that. They started buying a lot of our product even before the deals are done. Last year, I got our farmers $16 billion because they were targeted. And the year before I got them $12 billion. I just took them out of the tariffs, and we had a lot leftover. And I said, congratulations farmers. I love you. I love our farmers. They love me. That's why they did, they targeted our farmers. I said, congratulations. That's compliments of China. And they do. They want to make a deal so badly. Frankly, honestly, they want to make a deal a lot more than I want to make a deal. That's the way it is. Because we're doing very well right now with China. We're replacing the NAFTA disaster with the US, Mexico, Canada agreement. A huge win for Kentucky farmers, for Kentucky auto workers, for Kentucky manufacturers. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi so far and the do nothing Democrats don't want to give the people of our country a victory. It's really, let it be a bipartisan deal. I don't care. It's such an incredible deal for this country, and NAFTA was one of the worst deals ever made. Democrats need to pass the US MCA. We need their votes. Otherwise you can't pass it. And it's up to Pelosi who has to put it forward, but she's too busy wasting their time. So either pass it or go back to San Francisco and clean up your mess. The Obama Biden's administration's trans-Pacific partnership would have dealt the death blow to the American auto industry. That would have been one of the great catastrophes. My first week in office, I canceled that job-killing travesty. You know all about it. Under our policies just days ago, Ford and the UAW announced a $1 billion investment in Louisville. 1 billion. Before my election, our leaders used the great American middle-class as a piggy bank to fund their delusional global projects. They were globalists. I was elected to be president of the United States, not president of the globe. They decimated American manufacturing to promote economic growth in foreign countries. Tell me, how is that good. They try and convince you it's good. I was a very good student. I'm a very like, we're all smart. We sit back, we listen, and I say, these people are, something wrong with them. Only in Kentucky can somebody be so precise. You're right about, you are right about that. They deployed our military to protect immensely wealthy nations, subsidizing their welfare states with your money. The money we spend on other country's militaries, but it's coming down. And I'm telling other countries, I'm sorry, you're going to have to pay now. I'm sorry. Pay. Pay. Pay, you got to pay. And they poured precious American blood and treasure into the Middle East while our great cities fell into decay and disrepair. We go in for internet. We want rural, we'll bring it in. And we're bringing 5g into places like Kentucky that haven't been properly served. We're bringing it in all over the middle West, all over the country. And we're really ahead of schedule. We're doing really well. People will be very surprised soon when some numbers come out, but we're doing very well. But you were very much underserved for years. And yet we're investing billions and billions of dollars in places you've never even heard of. Doesn't make sense, does it? But after years of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. We are finally putting America first. Yet the deep state and the failed ruling class are trying to resist any changes to their failed policies of the past. They believe it is their right to rule over you and to redistribute your wealth all around the world. No thank you. No thank you. That's why we ended the Paris Accord. That's why\\u2026 We've ended a lot. I don't even want to tell you. But the sellout of the American nation ended the day I took the oath of office and you understand that. Past leaders transform far away nations into chaotic war zones. Then they demanded that America accept unlimited migration from those terror afflicted regions. Take the people, take the people. We defeated ISIS. We. When I took over three years ago, when we took over, when I took over, ISIS was all over. I defeated ISIS. I didn't even know to what extent. I was watching the other night the great Lou Dobbs, and he said, \\\"When Trump took over, President Trump,\\\" he used to say, \\\"Trump is a great president.\\\" Then he said, \\\"Trump is the greatest president since Ronald Reagan.\\\" Then he said, \\\"No, no, Trump is an even better president than Ronald Reagan.\\\" And now he's got me down as the greatest president in the history of our country, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. Thank you. We love you too. But we didn't fight them over there only to invite them over here. We didn't do that. We're not doing that. You see what we're going and you see what we're doing and you see it's never easy because I get hit by the swamp 15 different ways, but it doesn't matter. We're doing the right thing to protect our communities. My administration implemented the travel ban on some of the world's most dangerous countries. A lot of people were against it. They said, \\\"Isn't that terrible?\\\" Countries that have crime rates that are so high you wouldn't even believe it's possible, and we have a travel ban now. We don't take people from those countries. I'm sorry. And we won a historic victory on the travel ban in the United States Supreme Court, ruled it totally constitutional. On no issue have Democrats more totally betrayed you than on immigration. Democrats want open borders. They want to give illegal aliens free healthcare, free education, more advantages than our own citizens have and more benefits than our own military gets. In the Republican party, we believe taking care of our own citizens first is paramount. Thanks to our tireless efforts to secure our Southern border, illegal crossings have dropped 60% since May. The wall is being built. It's going up rapidly. It's got a big impact. And I want to thank Mexico. We have 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border policing our border because the Democrats will not do anything to end loopholes. It would take us 15 minutes and we could end the loopholes. Think of the word loopholes. They don't want to end the loophole. If you want to keep violent criminal aliens out of your communities, you have only one choice tomorrow, and that's to vote for Matt Bevin. Democrats are becoming more extreme and militant by the day. The Democrat's planned government takeover of healthcare would obliterate Medicare. What are they doing? I will always protect Medicare for our nation's seniors. It's going to be protected. What they're doing is crazy. And we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will also protect you with preexisting physicians. How about that? Preexisting physicians. First time I've ever said that, just thought of that. True. Because under their plan, you don't get your own doctor. You know what you get? Whatever the hell you get. That's what you get. Oh great doc, fix me up doc. You mean you want to work on my heart? Who are you, doc? I don't think so. Thanks to our campaign to combat the opioid epidemic with your governor's help, we have seen a 17% drop in overdose deaths in Kentucky, which is a record. Democrats have also waged an unrelenting assault against people of faith. Anybody in here a person of faith? Great people. The last administration threatened adoption and foster care agencies purely for their religious beliefs. Last week my administration took action to stop that Obama era assault. It was an assault. And governor Matt Bevin is a national leader on behalf of vulnerable children, and there is no better leader than him, what he has done. And together we're fighting for American orphans, foster families, and the sacred rights of religious believers. And he's done a fantastic job. Virtually every top Democrat also now supports late term abortion, ripping babies straight from their mother's womb right up until the moment of birth. And that's why I've asked Congress to prohibit extreme late term abortion because Republicans believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. The Republican party is the party of the American worker, the American family, the American dream, and it's the party of the great Abraham Lincoln. We forgot that. Abraham Lincoln. The incredible rebuilding of our military includes over $100 billion investments all across the state of Kentucky. I withdrew our nation from the horrible one sided Iran nuclear deal. It's not the same country. When I came in that country, there were in 18 different sites of confliction, they called it. And now they're a little different, a little different. We'll see what happens with Iran. And I recognize Israel's true capital and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. For years, you watched as your politicians apologized for America. Remember? He'd go around, oh, thank you so much. He wouldn't apologize to you, but he apologized to others. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and we are standing up for the people of Kentucky. The next step to victory begins tomorrow and it begins with all of you. You have to do this. Look, maybe you'll be late for work. Maybe you'll be late for whatever. I don't want to know everything. Some things I don't want to know, but you have to just put it off. You have to go vote. It's so important. Tomorrow is so, because beyond even the governorship, and it's so important. Because again, your state is setting records. In the history of your state, you've never done this well economically, job wise, unemployment, employment, factories moving in, new factories, open expansion of your car plants. You've never done this well, but you're sending that big message to the rest of the country. It's so important. You got to get your friends, you got to vote. Because if you lose, it sends a really bad message. It just sends a bad, and they will build it up. Here's the story. If you win, they're going to make it like ho hum. And if you lose, they're going to say, Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. This was the greatest. You can't let that happen to me. And you know what? You can't let that happen to your incredible state, Kentucky. You can't let that happen. That would be a disaster for yourself because you'd be losing an incredible governor. But you're going to have a great victory tomorrow. With your support, you have to go out and vote. We will show the corrupt Democrats that the American people are not backing down and we will never ever back down. So tomorrow, we need you to go out and get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors. Get out and vote for governor Matt Bevin and all of these great Republicans. With your help, we will lift millions more of our citizens from welfare to work, dependence to independence and poverty to prosperity. Together we will elect a Republican Congress. 2020, we're going to re-elect because of their stupidity. These people are on the run, and I will campaign in every one of those states that were so corrupt if they raise their hand. And don't forget. Out of 194, we got 194, not one Republican left us last week. And two Republicans, think of that. And the other three couldn't get there because of, but they were votes. They said they were totally votes, had airport problems. I said, you can't do that. Airport problems. But then we had the Democrats. We picked up two Democrats, so we had bipartisan support. That's unusual. I always say because they're lousy politicians, they've got lousy policy, but they do stick together. That's about it. We will elect a Republican Congress in 2020. And we'll have a great speaker of the house in Kevin. We're going to create a fair, safe, sane, and lawful system of immigration. We'll enact trade deals that result in more products proudly stamped with those beautiful words \\\"made in the USA\\\". We will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending, listen to this, the AIDS epidemic in America within less than 10 years. We've already started. Who would have felt we could have done that? We've started. In the past administration toward the end, we had certain things that we could have done. They didn't do anything. They didn't do anything, but we did. We have it all funded and we started, think of that, AIDS within 10 years will be out of this country. Nobody would have thought that was possible. We will end it. Great, great. I came into my office, they were telling me about the breakthroughs that have been made. It's incredible what they're doing. And don't forget right to try, by the way, where somebody who's terminally ill can now use our medicines, which they were never allowed to in the past. So instead of traveling to Asia and Europe and all over the world, or going home hopeless and dying, they can now use what we call right to try. We have the greatest doctors, the greatest drugs, greatest labs in the world. They can now go and try. And we are having unbelievable success. Unbelievable. Right to try. We will chart a new era of discovery in space, and someday soon we will land on, believe it or not, the surface of the moon only to go to Mars. You know I said we've done the moon. No, they say, sir, we land on the moon to go to Mars, and that's what we're doing with the moon. And we are really, really advanced. It's moving along rapidly. We will defend privacy, free speech, free assembly, religious liberty, and the right to keep and bear arms. And above all, we will never stop fighting for the cherished values that bind us together as one America. We support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States. We stand with the incredible heroes and warriors of law enforcement. We believe in the dignity of work and the sanctity of life. We believe that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the true American way. We believe that children should be taught to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. Loyal citizens like you helped build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. The great state of Kentucky was settled by some of the most devoted and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the earth. These tough pioneer men and strong pioneer women braved the wilderness and defied the danger to build a life and to build a home. They didn't have a lot of money. They didn't have a lot of luxury. But they all had one thing in common. They love their families, they love their country and they love their God. These proud Kentucky Patriots did not shed their blood, sweat and tears so that we could sit at home while others try to erase their legacy and destroy their magnificent heritage. Our allegiance is to our nation. Our loyalty is to our citizens. And our devotion is to our Creator. For the sake of our freedom, for the sake of our children, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We are one movement. We are one people. We are one family and one glorious nation under God. America is thriving like never before. And ladies and gentlemen of Kentucky, the best is yet to come. Together, we will make America wealthy again. We will make America strong again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And we will make America great again. Thank you, Kentucky. Thank you. Go out and vote.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Ciudad\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 32,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Tupelo\",\n          \"Cincinnati\",\n          \"Tulsa\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Fecha\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2019-07-17 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2020-09-22 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020-06-20 00:00:00\",\n          \"2020-02-20 00:00:00\",\n          \"2019-11-04 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Dia\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 7,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 30,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 21,\n        \"samples\": [\n          19,\n          3,\n          22\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mes\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 12,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          6,\n          9,\n          7\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"A\\u00f1o\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 2019,\n        \"max\": 2020,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2020,\n          2019\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r_vote\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0005503311507452794,\n        \"min\": 0.00034340659340659343,\n        \"max\": 0.003016759776536313,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0007126948775055679,\n          0.0007722007722007722\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r_tax\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0005606640885197824,\n        \"min\": 0.0001606812886639351,\n        \"max\": 0.002440424921045076,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 35,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0005345211581291759,\n          0.0006006006006006006\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r_campaing\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r_economy\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.00022690315178007533,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0008974243919949744,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.000450112528132033\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Y_M\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2020_Jun\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
